that's not what we're looking for and it's through some dialogue with builders and developers that we developed this ordinance but we have no other ordinance that the council has said I want to still hear it I want to hear it even if it meets all the requirements unless it's a subdivision of property because I think that you are still a little bit unsure if you want to do that right I will say from the ordinance that you've written this is about as close to what it was at that time so if there's still some concerns about is it still checking off the boxes of what we want then we probably do need to take a step further and really learn our recall one time when we did there was an opinion that we were getting allowing two small of lots well landing was a great example of that and the well landing I think is a great neighborhood today because it has a great HOA and we did we learn some things in that neighborhood of course we did we don't want long streets like we have today and well landing so you can't have it but at the time we don't like it's too many houses and we started asking ourselves what don't you like about it what don't you like about it and at the time the common denominator appeared to be that we weren't necessarily the target audience for that product and then the consensus basically came and said and that may be okay you know that where we may not see ourselves living there but there was still a need for that you know in our community and then today you know a decade later that's still a great neighborhood but you know in the development of our city and the development redevelopment of this neighborhood we probably have one opportunity to get it right you know so what does that look like because I can tell you there's there's more interest in redeveloping this I'd like to say it's because the city's invested more in infrastructure in that couple of block area then we have in any other area of our community now you may be asking yourself scratching your head thinking like how is that possible but because that's because the city's largely been built by private development that the city's accepted the infrastructure afterwards but for the city to go back in and do the beautification and the streets gaping widening the road in front of more of those little things that's why I say we've spent more there and that's not why the church is investing there that's not why we're investing here I think that's all happening because we care and we all want to get it right so there is merit to what you're saying I think the historical society may have a good you know but that's to keep in mind that they can't
