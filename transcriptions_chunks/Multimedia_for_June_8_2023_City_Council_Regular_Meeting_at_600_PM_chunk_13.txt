can't see her, but can I be smart? But look, you did a wonderful job. Thank you for your service to the community. We really appreciate it. Yeah. Look, someone told me a long time ago, the best is past president, the best position. That's so cool. It's all right. Thank you, Ken. Miss Shampa. Thank you, Mayor. I have one question first. I guess Terry, the veterans' park. Will it be finished for the 4th of July? It looks really nice. Adopt the four prior to the veteran they it looks really nice. Coming along. Yeah, this would be a big ASA. I'd like to welcome Tap Room. I think that's the newest business this month that we have come into the city. So I know they had a lot of people there this week. So hopefully that continues. It's a really good venue for people. I'd also like to wish all the day is out there happy for this day. So enjoy your day and have fun with your family. All right. Thank you, Miss Shampa. Any other announcements or business before the council? All right. Is there a motion to adjourn? Motion. All right. Thank you. Is there a second? All right. All in favor? All right. Meeting and adjourn. Have a great evening. Thank you so much.
