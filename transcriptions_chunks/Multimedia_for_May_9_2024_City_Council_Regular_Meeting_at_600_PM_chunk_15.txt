project's been planned for years so um all right well if this it's Susan do you have anything else relative to this or no I don't okay uh well if I could since we're talking about water I just want to take a moment um and I acknowledge Terry in a second to talk but our water superintendent is here Alex meseral and I want to just acknowledge our utilities director I'm so proud I'd have Alex on the team of course a man is here one of our supervisors and public works as well but DHH I guess it is does LDH does grading of water systems that's something new that started last year and Alex made me a commitment that he'd have both of our water systems in an A status and we got the grades released May 1st and they both our wholesale water system and our youngs will produce system both were in A on May 1st so it's by no means a victory lap because as you just heard we have a lot of work to still do in water uh in sewer but I'm just so proud that under Terry's leadership we've been able to assemble a phenomenal team that I couldn't be more proud of from their uh from their certifications and the work that they're putting in day to day so Terry I just wanted to give you an opportunity as well okay just kind of give everybody a little history on this a few years back we uh we decided to kind of reach out and see what we needed as far as for a utility department we're growing so much to kind of separate some of the public works uh jobs versus utilities job and you know we we put out some information out there on qualifications and all that and then this light bulb went off and say hey wait we got these guys already and they've been here for a few years Alex actually has his level fours and water across the board um and then we have a few more members uh Stesson Peters he's not here tonight he has his level threes we have a way jaminette that has his level twos and of course we have a man that which is in public works that uh she has a level one so we we stacked up as far as for personnel with certifications uh one of our other members in water uh cane truss claire is one of our younger incoming incoming uh training with Alex and so we're we're hoping to build that uh that team even stronger so yeah my hats off to him a lot of work and if you ever dealt with DHH it's a lot of work a lot of paperwork a lot of checks and balances so uh you know i'll applaud and great job yeah thank thank you Alex and Amanda the whole team uh Amanda's our line
