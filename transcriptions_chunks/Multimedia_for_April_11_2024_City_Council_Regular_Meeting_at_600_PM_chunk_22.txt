put back in zone A so these the remapping puts many of those back into zone X so we want to make sure we have it right to address for many of our property owners to get the benefit so that's the next part is so that they get the benefit of your detention ponds with getting placed back in a zone X how that's going if they have current insurance it won't necessarily bring it down what it will do is make it not necessary if they don't want to have it if you're in zone A it's required the way they are now addressing costs and I just want to say that in case once the mapping's done people say my interest didn't go down the risk is how they're now giving you your prices they have a whole new pricing system as what they call risk rating 2.0 so that pricing system changed so many people have seen a huge increase but what it will do is just make it not mandatory so right now if you're in A it's mandatory if you're still mortgaging your house so I might not we might not be able to get you a decrease but we might get it to where you don't necessarily have to have it that's and that's not gonna be fair we said division but we're trying to bring it as many we want to so the mapping is tedious work but it's gonna be worth it in the end for the homes that'll benefit and I can say just based upon you know dry ditches and what we saw after having such a high intensity rain event yesterday they did their jobs yesterday and that so we're very happy to have another one another rain event but we are seeing that they're still working we're still working with the property owners doing some minor shifts on the what we're calling the South Connect or Launccia ma'am so that hopefully we can make the next move forward to start doing the actual plan so we're still working and tweaking that alignment and we don't have any new things to report on 92 press Scott other than we were at 30% with and we had completed our survey all right okay there is just what you mentioned by you park Purdue I mean there's survey markers that are out Miss Deanna maybe you've noticed there's a survey that did everything on along by you park Purdue from young so highway to the sports complex doing survey because they're creating plans and they're gonna go and it's a parish job so they're gonna be removing saltation so you know hopefully we'll be seeing that get in there also on Anselham as well so like around the Veterans Park that channel there there's also survey marks around there and La Sal. La Sal is one of the the ladders to La Sal. That's wonderful. I think that's the first
