full throttle at our existing plan there's a second component which is an elevated storage tank on in our southern city limits that will help boost and strengthen the LUS purchase system we operate two systems here so I want to just review kind of both of them you know what was the goal when you know how we're accomplishing and how is that relative to our current rate of growth today is this all started with the growth study yes that's where five years ago yeah maybe so I think it's just incumbent upon and we can do this pretty quickly I'm just talking about like an internal workshop where we can get up to get up to speed on it is the water sectors ask that we've met all we've met all hurdles now they're asking us to bid the project within 30 days so that's what I wanted to convey to you today sure sure yeah and yeah and they want our comments on their rate study so I think we all need to be on the same page as to how we want to go forward and what we do want to do with regard to the rates absolutely yeah okay all right any questions for Susan all right are there any are there any other staff or council comments our announcements yes sir oh oh I'll come back to you Miss Creed all right mr.
