I'm gonna call it a repair from fortune road back or basically sable pumps back here that we could have like a patching milling and overlay in the interim while we're designing because there are so many utilities that we're working on and individual businesses we need to see but it's not gonna stop us from doing the other part the contractor on 89 while we with the GMP now that we've kind of gone through and found um funding mechanisms for some of the other projects that we have we can do and we do have enough money for for that phase so the phase that we want to do and the plans that we have you you have enough money right now for that did that push the timeline back on completion from that original point I'm assuming because I think we first started this it was like three years maybe maybe a hinge more from like beginning conversations completion and drawable I'm assuming that pushed it back to another six months to a year I would have to say probably six months but keeping in mind that when we had said like three years from that point knowing just like around about normally takes you 15 months but could take you a little bit longer because it was this so we did put some additional into that but what we said to do the whole thing all the way back down to the roundabout was gonna be close at a five years to get all of that done just because you can't close it all at the same time so you may have added six months maybe not if you end up having good weather like you had this last year then you can be surprised how much you can get done. Well again last week I mean there's I appreciate the question because there are so many move in pieces I mean to all of this the funding the plans the even when funding comes at the state level getting it through the bond commission getting the contracts approved it's it's extremely lengthy and then you know you you really need it all to be complete before you can direct the contractor like where is he starting where is he stopping recognizing like how long is they holding their price for there's just there's been a there's been a lot of variables I think the good news right now is we're taking advantage to the best of our ability or trying to leverage to our advantage to the best of our ability new new legislators and also a new administration because we have close to three million dollars and I've referred to it as monopoly money credits because we've initially taken ownership of 89 so now we have their credits but we're trying to determine how can we best apply those credits we've spent years trying to play the game of okay I have your credits
