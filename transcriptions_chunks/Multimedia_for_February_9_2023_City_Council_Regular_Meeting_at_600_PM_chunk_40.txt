picked up and uh a few people said we don't believe you and the best I can tell you is testing because we don't happen uh so we're we're uh but anyway we're looking forward to it I can tell you that the um the permit number um is higher than we've ever seen before one 30 is simply is the float number the the register number including dance teams uh it's in excessive yeah so you can expect you can expect I would expect it to be a probably a four-hour parade you know at at at minimum um after every parade we uh do it after action debriefing uh is with most incidents or you know things that we do continuous improvement um you know we'll probably continue to ask ourselves the question should we cap it what's the number what does it look like um you know the big takeaways last year were more barricades and more policing I can I can tell you that we've already achieved both of those so there'll be more barricades along the route and there'll be more law enforcement uh than before so I'm sure that there'll be some new opportunities created this year and we'll respond uh accordingly as they come up so captain shot well anything from the fire department that's you want to share and then we'll get the council updates and then that's all I have the the numbers from 2022 on the uh calls that we went on ran a total of 955 30 none of those being structured fires 59 of those being fires like vehicle fires grass fires different things like the head 311 alarms 373 medical calls 73 wrecks with or without rescue in a hundred that uh there's too hard to put together all of that with an average response time of four minutes and 45 seconds which is awesome a lot of that's due to the increased staffing two stations spread it out and I can only imagine how much it's gonna go down whenever we get to station three on the south side um aerial what did they say you were in response was it uh another month on the truck on the truck we're about to get delivered uh uh no we only have it for the bridge oh really that quit okay I knew you the more good you want to uh you can put the pictures now if you want yeah so we're getting a new uh aerial it's about to be delivered they just got back from Wisconsin going to do the final inspection January 1st our new rescue slash engine got put in service so our fleet will all be updated which is awesome it's gonna save a lot of money in uh repair costs yeah that's it killing my hydrate yeah it's 107 foot stick the truck that we have right now with the elevated massive stream is a 2000 99 99 99 2000
