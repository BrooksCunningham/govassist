that's going to be behind the setback this is at the horse arena property that's already has a you know pretty nice fence there um so despite scrubbing the project and despite um despite scrubbing it and despite getting the you know the five million dollar grant we found ourselves in a situation that it's more so uh Susan and I have already sent communication to the water sector commissioner what we're seeking is um to get more grant money we did some numbers I think our ask is reasonable um of course this was this was a competitive bid process when we applied for it um we scored really well um we scored well for several reasons one of them was because we uh committed to a pretty decent match we committed to a 76% match so for every dollar and grant we are receiving we're committing to put up 76 cents of you know equal so it was pretty competitive uh I think Susan did not stand in job with the application and hence the reason it scored well so our ask um is that we get we're asking for 50% more on the grant uh while keeping our match the same dollar amount so in essence it lowers our match to like 51 or 52 cents on every dollar so um I guess tonight I'm really just wanting to give you an update about it we have I believe 45 days to actually award the bid um that would put us still within the wind of the June council meeting and I hope uh buy then uh if not sooner I'll have a proposal for you and the funding mechanisms um to be able to to um execute accepting the low bid on this project so we also have some that's I think going to help us with our scoring a little bid if you recall y'all gave me authorization to uh service those two neighborhoods off of Bonan and the unincorporated area uh think that that also boasts our advantage because it's like can be considered a consolidation of systems and that system was having performance issues uh so um we think that we have a compelling argument um to do now of course this is just a water treatment plant we still have the elevated storage tank some interconnections some other components that we need to do but for today we're really just look we're planning them all the water storage tanks ready to go as well but we're wanting to release these out for bidding making sure that we're not getting the head of our self with the finances as well so really just wanted to give you guys an update and uh and I'll keep you posted you know on our success with the water sector commission and seeking more funding so any questions about that or what kind of where we are and that we've been waiting on this for sometime this
