four would be what we consider the remaining site elements except for the concession stand That's about 65 to 70% complete and we estimate that those plans will be done on or about April 14th middle of April And lastly would be design package number five, which is the concession stand and we estimate that about 30% complete and We look to those plans being done in late May around late 19 Any questions for Chris or Stuart as well I think what you're seeing here is that is the the beauty and the benefit of a C more project. I mean this is all this is I mean There's dirt being moved on this site today Because of the early design package number one that you're seeing here on the screen And it's being phased in being reviewed internally and then being released out so From my vantage point it's working really well as intended you know the legislature gave a special permission and approve Would it treat this as a construction manager at risk project Difference being that the plans on have to be a hundred percent done and dropped all and then we hope for the best the day We open the bid we're working with the contractor that our committee selected to price it in each each step along the way so now very exciting and I believe for the for the public's benefit or for all of your benefit as well I mean, we're still looking at this time next year roughly for completion of the of the expansion But of the phase that we've authorized to move forward which is the amphitheater to full-size baseball fields the pickle ball courts and then parking Yeah, and we would construct all the drainage on side effectively both ponds. Yes So those are those will be set up when the baseball fields do come into the other ones. Yes Dranges all there for them So basically stubbed out to where when we do the two other fields and then in an interim period It's gonna have you have open green space that can still certainly be used for recreational purposes But the infrastructure it'll be less invasive when we do have the money to go in and and build up the second phase similar to how we did with sugar beach Comments or questions about this I'm open and for comments or questions just because this is the first time we've had You know in a good official update I would not be keeping the council abreast through your updates in the packet as well So Stuart sorry, I don't see us having to Leave the site so that we're on site. We should be able to keep working and these design packages should You know, everybody can keep it from Perfect we'll do we'll do our part because All right, well, we thank y'all we appreciate it very pleased with the progress in the way this
