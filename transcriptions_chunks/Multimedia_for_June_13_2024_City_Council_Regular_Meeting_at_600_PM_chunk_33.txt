on July 3rd. So thank you for the reminder. Any other council announcements? Any other business before the council? All right. I'll entertain a motion to adjourn if there's one. Motion to adjourn by Ms. Barras, seconded by Councilman Volgiano. Actually, let's do this. Gidry. I always forget we have a computer. Meeting adjourned. Thank you all so much. I have a great evening.
