when you do that to get to my property. But that's been basically resolved it's not quite as bad if I time things just right I can I can get by and I'm okay but I am against that extra traffic we've had all these subdivisions coming up around us it has created such traffic and I just don't even want to think about what it would be like to have additional traffic here this has been this has been a very quiet we've been in in the old section it's been a very quiet and a very good neighborhood for raising children for for having peace and comfort and as I'm getting older that's what I'm looking for so I do thank you for your consideration and and I would be against it I would definitely if I had a vote in it I would say no. Okay thank you thank you ma'am Mr. Bull John. I just want to thank all of you the downtown residents that came tonight and spoke up we greatly appreciate it takes a lot of courage to get up here and speak your your mind and your opinions but I just want to make sure that I make myself clear that because I don't want to be characterized as someone who wants to have downtown completely revamped and just have loads of these in here what I was merely trying to make a conversation point and I was is that this isn't the first this isn't the last time this is going to happen since I've been on council now being where in the middle of my second term this is probably the 12th of the 13th development that's come for this exact reason. Young's will can be labeled at times being difficult to do business with difficult to to invest in and these gentlemen have invested their time and a lot of money and energy into this exact development I'm not sitting here saying that I agree with it that's exactly what young zone needs. If y'all told me today that you wanted every open lot and downtown to stay empty for the end of time then we'll stamp it today and science will deliver but let's make the decision because what we keep having is we keep having developers coming here and wasting the time and money and energy and putting their next line on what they're doing. We want to put up science plaques we want to preserve it for as for the end of time I'm 100% all about that but I think from a council standpoint we need to make that decision because you know I think Miss Ray said it best is things are changing you know look with change comes growing pains and that's just that's just part of life. It's why it's called tomorrow and yesterday is yesterday things are different yesterday today tomorrow is going to be different as well. I would love to
