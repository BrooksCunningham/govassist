six, items one through four are to be funded by the general fund and you can see with those are those again, general operations. You've got a gravely more, you've got a bush hog, you've got a payloader, you got a bridge at Savowal Road, all paid by the general fund but it pertains to the streets and drainage department. The 1981 sales tax which as everyone knows is to fund mainly the police department and that's a half cent sales tax that goes into it and you have items five, six and seven. You have three patrol units, totaling $183,000, you have a server replacement and the axon enterprise, $275,000 total capital for the police department, it's funded at 478,000 and again, the total funding is coming from the half cent sales tax from 1981. Now items eight through 13 is the capital projects of fund expenditures. It's in that separate set of books for specifically those purposes. All of this is considered to be street improvements and as some big numbers here and what Catherine and her staff did, as you can see, they broke it out like item number nine for example, highway 89 widening improvements. She's got 4,360, which is state capital outlay monies and then your match is 1,453, which is a 25% match and it's coming from the 2022 nine million dollar sales tax bond issue. That's how we're gonna fund it. So you're gonna put up your portion from some bond it monies that we have. Item number 10 is another big item, fortune road extension and roundabout. 4,309 coming from the state and another 1.4 million, which is the 25% match coming from the city of Young'sville again from the nine million sales tax bond issue, which has been funded. Shem and Metery Parkway widening street improvements here, total from the state, $3,500, $151,000 from the sales tax fund and another 600,000 from House Bill 782. So that's really state funding in my correct manner. That's what we added that we had to add after we started our discussions and that's definite we're gonna get it. Yes, it's been signed. Good. So basically this project is almost entirely funded by state projects. With the, well, the entire capital projects for streets and drainages with the exception of the 25% match. It's all funded there. Yes. And the next one is on the Longland A extension overlay, 660,000 coming from the state capital outlay, the other 25% match, 220,000 coming from the bond issue, the nine million bond issue. Item number 12, but again, it's a big item here is La Rivea road improvements and reconstruction and the state funding or federal highway grant here is 1,486. This is directly from the Feds or it's passed through to the state. This is passed through the states. This is managed by the Acadiana Planning Commission. This is a grant that we applied for probably six, seven years ago. It's finally coming to fruition. So
