that's what I'm telling you we have three the blue was temporary moved to the person that we can't talk about it it would not mention that person's name that's where the blue is for all practice purpose because the person that was in the blue position would cover the shift because we need that person more partly there and I'm covering where that blue person is I'm taking those again okay they're under me okay so you yeah he's filling the blue the new SRO and the open on B correct that's correct yeah that's the three the new SRO is a separate item that we have proved yes so you have two open positions to fill that is correct and our class we're adding the arca I'm sorry you're arca arca only has jet correct right now that's the only officer they have right and the one that you'll just approve all ago would be for this new person yeah which is separate from the open positions that's correct sounds too open okay yes we had one at orca yes covering I think the what they would call lower school they're opening their high school yes and they want another one for the high school so the one that is on the chart that you're approving is the one for the high school okay I know we're on I'm determined this chiefs the day do they give any inclination they want to have a second one of the high school eventually to someone of what southside has yes yes okay because my understanding they probably their students on campus will probably more than southside now so what we're looking at then besides all of that is you're trying to put five officers on each shift instead of four right and creating a fifth spot or a fourth spot I'm sorry three four yeah three or four and then another traffic officer's what's that it's correct okay can I get very efficient when you table everything that did not include the three percent for the the men and when I know okay I just want to clarify it was all staff officers oh yeah okay I think that was one of the first things I was mentioned okay so to clarify looks like there's one open position that was budgeted last year okay the way to win last year for the last budget year y'all gave us three and then we could fill one per quarter but in the process as we was filling vacancies we also lost people so again we're just still trying to fill the vacancies that we had from last year and the three that we got given to us last year and then for this budget year that's coming up that's why we actually additional four that way we could put one more person on each shift hmm just curious the traffic department do they have set hours like are do they supplement the
