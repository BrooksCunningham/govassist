of stuff my pitch did get over the plate motorway it didn't hit the ground it curved a little bit but I know I caught it from my daughter who pitches the only thing I'm going to say is it's one of my favorite times of year martyr girl with the parade that we have and everything I think we do for y'all do a formal job setting it up for all of us when we get to repair all the benefits of it during the parade 60 degrees for the parade is what it's showing right now I know that's a long way out but uh sunny looking nice sunny 60 degrees and uh how long I gotta say is just uh go buy some more beans yeah it's that many permits yes mr. bulljianan uh just a couple of quick things about highlight uh we did uh get back as well since shed from the uh from less constant today um one thing that stood out to me was uh apple tunnel mines move uh uh I guess have a a a smaller young soul that happens and kind of grew into it is today and so as we continue to grow and new businesses continue to come in um they really shed the light on how many jobs they provide for their plant uh how much revenues is uh is generated through them so as we continue to welcome new businesses to come in what that will bring for us in hindsight uh in the generations to come as jobs are revenue uh so some of them they seem like it's we're taking over our city and it may be daunting but in reality it's it's a much larger thing than that so your jobs and rather than coming I think it just uh it's a big life for them um I did have the pleasure flying home with a destined foray today on the plane that was kind of cool uh he did uh mention and said that he's excited to bring his family and uh enjoy the parade with us as our grandmarshall also uh we talked about the retention ponds uh the aerial view if you have it a flood a young soul never you know in your future it's insane because in the last five years the things that I've seen you fought at night time you can literally see the sports complex in bro bridge yeah without a doubt today you're gonna fly on a daytime was nice just to see it it's just a clean uh unique set up timidestap your phenomenal job and to see an aerial view and I came with you with expansions done that'll be really great uh but the pond on the Riviera is like a crater you can see that crystal clear from so far away so if it looks like it's daunting it's not that big from the road trust me it's it's huge
