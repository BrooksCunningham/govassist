so again, if you're all going to excuse me. Absolutely. You have a good night. Take care. All right, a gin item 4.4, Mr. Todd East is here this evening to announce this candidacy for City Council division D. Thank you for giving me some of the questions. Thank you. Thank you for giving me some opportunities to speak. I'm Todd East. I'm running for division D council. I've been here. Let me take some stuff apart. Maybe you may not know. I'm a deep, deep routine community. I'm a Catholic, Christian, Republican, America and who I'm very proud of. And I, my schooling, I wanted to be a Catholic priest. I haven't said that in about 35 years. So when I went to college, I took theology. Took every theology to get me ready for the seminary. I realized that God had a different plan for me. And that's why I stand here before you today. So I took it all too in school. But I always wanted to do good. I traveled throughout the world for the Catholic charities and other ministries, staying months at a time, delivering food, and budgeting. Now I run a successful company with five or six trucks. I operate it. And with my wife too, we help. She helps. We do good. And we're growing. I see the budget. Let me skip to the budget. Did you look at my core DC budget management on there? I don't see it as just a budget. I see not just numbers or calculators or a book, but I see families. I see roads. I see the men and women that come to work every day. You want to look into the budget. I see the peace department where I support. I see the fire department. And I see that the budget means a lot to me. And as you know, I ask for the budget every time. It means a lot to me. Because I look into it. And I see Tim's the sports complex. I see a lot of things. And that's why I'm running for city council. Because God has set my path. And that's the way I am. So I prayed about it. And I asked my wife about it. And I saw about it. And that's why you, I'm here for you today. So I'd like to ask for you to support on November 5th. Thank you. Todd, thank you. Invest in the law. Thank you. Appreciate you being here with us this evening, sir. agenda item 5.1 is approval of the August 8th, 2024 meeting. Is there a motion?
