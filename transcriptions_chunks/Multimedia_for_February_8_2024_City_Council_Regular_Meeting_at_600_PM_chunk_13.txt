else to do a mill and overlay of Youngso highway from like stable palms you know towards copperfield to which we can build on the exterior lanes and a future capital outlay project so appreciate Shannon and Jamie gone and conveying that on our behalf today that's also what our administration with Pam's help has conveyed to our our new legislators the local DOTD office did say that they would be in support of it and that they would tee it up with the new secretary so we're optimistic that we'll continue to get that level of support because our belief is that there's projects that that are in the queue that may not be able to actually go through funding we're part of our three million dollars and credits could be slid in therefore applied to the Seymour project as an amendment and we get to continue seamlessly on Youngso highway without just depending on solely capital outlay so any help would be appreciated yes so did I yes you did convey that and I mean I honestly think you're the three million dollars just so everybody knows when they did part of that three million when you took it was based upon how they calculated the when they were gonna you started this road transfer with highway 89 in 2012 under Wilson's administration so when they calculated from your first road transfer it was based on those dollars so I believe you've already given them a very good bargain because I can assure you you can't do anything in 2024 that you could do in 2012 for 1.8 million dollars so we've deaf the good thing is this was the first and we had a meeting several weeks ago and it was the first time the guy in Baton Rouge actually agreed that he had seen his jump through enough hoops that he in fact is also going to support that we have run out of options I mean and it's not because he didn't try everything he could and we're just like we're at a point now that the longer you do it the three million dollars is going to be like not even having anything and that's not the spirit of which the city took on this road and and I and I can't say with everything else we've seen from all the other agencies and just the short 40 days payment to communities and getting money to communities and everything else has been a hot button of this administration all the way across from GoSet and also office of community development and and everything we're here it they've all been instructed by the governor like people need to be paid communities need to be paid within 30 days and so they're trying to unlock the money because of course what's best for sales tech community recovery for anything then to start getting infrastructure so we have seen a huge trend in working with different project
