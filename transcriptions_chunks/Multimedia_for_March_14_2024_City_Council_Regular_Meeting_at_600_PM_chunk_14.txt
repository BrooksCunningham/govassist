setback and then another enhanced which is why when they asked for the 10 if you actually bought that much property on all the remaining parcels that you would have to widen I wouldn't have the money to be able to widen highwaying that much. You know what I mean I didn't see when they asked they had with if they was just wanted to be one thing but they've got two which is that 47 feet total and you already have a whole lot of either side or the back so that's correct that's right. They would be taken. So you have the road the private access road in between them and the daycare they have the storage in the back and then they have family dollar. So family dollars open late storage open you know so they meet all the requirements of even if they had you know a restaurant or boutique or whatever everybody else around them can go so that's why we felt that there was not going to be a problem with the five foot and not having an issue of extra barriers between them. Mayor the property I would like to motion to approve. All right thank you motion by Miss Shumphine second by Mr. Romero's any further council comment or discussion any public comment?

All right 7.5 Chad and Jessica Broussard are requesting a variance to allow a reduction of their garage set back from 25 to 20 feet for a lot 53 of sable south council this is a exciting development for me and I'm sure for you as well this is the newest phase the sable palms that we've that the developer has coin sable south that there's I think 80 or 80 ish lots in this particular development we recorded the final plot on February 29th they've met all the requirements to fulfill the development standards for development in the city of Youngsville. The developers been outstanding to work with Mr. Broussard. The understanding is of the 80 ish lots that have come into the market with this development I think he's told me all but maybe four or five of them are are spoken for have local builders that have ear marks on them to develop and we we have a couple of custom home plans that we have received in the permitting office that were specifically designed for these lots assuming that it would be a 20 foot front setback the developers reviewed and approved the request as reasonable and I have done the same as well so it's for your approval this evening. Mr. Romero. I'd like to go in motion to approve the variance
