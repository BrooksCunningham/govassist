discussion is perfectly understanding or not think we need to have that discussion maybe not tonight because we're not prepared to have that discussion but I do believe that should be put on the table of what we how we look at our downtown historic district what I call the historic district. And I have great pride and I have great pride in the people that live there even though I wasn't born and raised here I think it's very important to them so. No I'm not I'm not saying that it's not I mean I walk these streets to go to school my entire childhood I have friends that still live here family that's grown up this entire downtown district what I'm saying is that we this is the same conversation we have time and time again this will not be this isn't the first since it's not the last time development that will come here.

Our goal was to have affordable everybody wants to come to youngville you know beautiful city I love it and everybody wants to come here but they're being they can't find affordable housing and that's what we want to present is affordable something as beautiful as that that we actually enhance the neighborhood you know so it wasn't cost effective to buy the house so we ended up buying an empty lot. And if our so far
