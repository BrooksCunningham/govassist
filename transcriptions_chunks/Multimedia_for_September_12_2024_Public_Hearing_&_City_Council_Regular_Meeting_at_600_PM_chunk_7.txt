if we look at other neighborhoods, regardless of when it's churned over, I mean, typically while there's still lots that are able to be sold, the developer still likes to have some level of interest or involvement to ensure that the architectural integrity is being put in a place. So that's what that's for. All right. Well, I guess if that if it doesn't sound like any other discussion or comment. Okay. Well, then this item will leave it as is if there's not going to be a motion to accept the or to consider the revision. All right. Moving on. Let's go to agenda item 8.1. For resolutions resolution 2024 14 of resolution adopting the adjusted milled rates for the city of young so for 2024. Is there a motion on the second? Okay. Motion by Ms. Champagne in a second by council member Romero. Is there any public comment? The other discussion and question. Okay. Ms. Gidry, please call the vote. Ms. Cree. Yes. Ms. Champagne. Yes. Ms. Volgiano. I'm going to abstain just because the other funds do go towards partial department. Okay. And Mr. Romero. Yes. Motion approved. Okay. agenda 8.3 resolution 2024 16 resolution. No, excuse me. I think I stepped to skip to one resolution 2024 15 resolution is set forth. The adjusted milled rates and roll forward to milled rates not exceeding the maximum authorized rates for the city of young so for 2024. Is there a motion? All right. A motion by Mr. Romero in a second by Mrs. Cree. I'm Mr. Emerge. Yeah. I just want to make it known that you know we don't take action on these. Then it can put us in a difficult situation obviously because they're on the book so having a roll and forward is a need. I don't think that was mentioned earlier. Okay. This is Ms. Cree. Is that just the second or do you have any comment? Okay. Any council comment any other discussion from the council? Okay. Any public comment? Any public comment or public question relative to this resolution? Okay. If there's no additional comment, Ms. Gidry, please call the vote. Ms. Champagne? No. Ms. Bares? No. Mr. Volgiano? I'm sorry. Mr. Romero? Yes. Ms. Cree. Yes. Motion fails. It doesn't fail yet and I'm saying. We need for this requires a two thirds vote which is for Paul Johnson. Yes. Just for the council's knowledge. The property millage that was designated for fire protection and water works and everything was approved. I believe. I think we're four years five years in. Four five years in. There was a massive misopportunity at the time because of the explosive growth that we had in our community that the millage was not increased then. So those apartments were lacked in funding from the get-go five years ago. So roll not rolling them forward not only hinder's growth but it completely halts any growth for the foreseeable future.
