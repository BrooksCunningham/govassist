That's the really large one you can see from the sports complex. Then south of that's pond two. That's dug pond three. They are working on now and then pond four is 85% complete as far as for that. So the project overall is 70% complete. We're less than half through our construction time. So things are moving real well on Bailey Grove. Truly less south. That's about 65% complete with their digging. We've dug most of our what we call the good dirt so you're not going to see a whole lot more dirt being moved to highway 89. On the property that we have so there's not going to be a whole lot more movement with that. Fortune, the fortune road roundabout in the extension so our water and sewer plans are complete. We're going to get that to the state for permitting. We have finished our drainage design and our overall layout of the roundabout in the extension. Next week we are working on the quantity so that we can give that to the contractor so that they can give us their 60% GMP. So hopefully we get a good number that's within what we can contract and we can give them the notice to proceed not long after that start, ordering pipe. But they are going to start doing their clearing. They have a contract already for the clearing and getting everything ready along highway 89 and also in the area for the fortune road extension as well. For we are starting next week on the survey for Velasco crossing so that we can do the design on that. On our 2022 roadway improvement program, our next we are finished Marito, Almanaster and just for clarification, nothing failed. In case some people think, I think a lot of people think that there was a failure it wasn't. We had them go back in and do so we could have a smooth ride. We were addressing some driveways and we went back and put some more asphalt, milled it, got a little bit smoother ride. Our next road will be North La Rivier to do that one. Now that the contractor is no longer moving the dirt on North La Rivier from the Koolie La Salle project. So that will be our next one as soon as we know we will give the mayor heads up so that he can put that out. La Rivier road preliminary plans, the preliminary hydraulics report and the preliminary drainage report were submitted to the state that's under review. We're still continuing on moving forward. We're not anticipating a huge redesign so we're going to continue doing going to the next phase while they have it in their review. And Anselam Koolie, we're waiting on the state, the mayor signed a cooperative endeavor agreement. We're waiting on them for notice to proceed before we can start doing site locations and the modeling for that particular project. And also one thing that
