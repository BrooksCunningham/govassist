doing ours a little bit different. It's a seam more But we can actually we have less packages than the sports complex So from a standpoint of the road We will have two phases. I'll reiterate that the first phase is from a little bit south of fortune to ambassador With the next phase being a little bit more complicated phase which is from the clock roundabout To wherever we stop phase one and um so but the unknown is the drainage We should be done within the next two weeks to get a gmp from the contractor.

So not quite um the hundred oak strives But um it's it's had it's it's challenges as well You will see in the next couple of weeks the contractor when they're done there They're going to move to marto road But there will also have a crew doing
