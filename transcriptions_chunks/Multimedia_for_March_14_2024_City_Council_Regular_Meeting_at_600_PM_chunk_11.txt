when the you know something is developed back there which I doubt Youngs you know the school is gonna be that's one of the reasons I bought that home just to come home and hear those kids playing yeah you know it's just it's perfect for me so anyway I'm prepared to do that okay more we appreciate need that document a lot to be a motion to grant two foot variance all right it's a motion to approve that the encroachment for the rear setback by mr. Boljana second by mr. Romero just to make one comment so this would be simply for the location the placement encroaching this setback you know if we start the you know if we do follow the permitting process I mean it's we won't be able to do any type of inspection you know on on the slab so that may be where the inspection group may just want to get some sort of you know hold harmless or something from you there because it's kind of hard to expect what they can't see so by the way I showed you the anchor boats the other day when you came out that's another reason why this this contractor is not a four and a half to five store after I got through with the step with the survey by Angie he dropped a half store one store they banned him nationwide so anyway um I was gonna say I got there in time the cement was still wet and the the the aspects you know the blueprint called for anchor boats to be every 26 to 28 inches this contractor had sporadic anchor boats and I caught that immediately the cement was still wet that were given in a few minutes before they'd work it and again I was bleeding through the ears and eyes so I made them get extra anchor boats and secure you know the correct amount of anchor boats around the perimeter you got it well it sounds like you got that in time otherwise this slab would have probably had to be drilled or broken up at my expense yeah because he refused to work with me so I Angie cutting loose yeah all right well thank you mr. Bruce is there any other council comment or any any public comment part of the vote okay if there's no additional public comment misgivier please call the vote on encroachment in the rear setback all in favor motion approved right so yeah thank you and absolutely thank you appreciate him so best of luck don't finish in your project sir right agenda item 7.4 I had the pleasure of meeting mr. Eddie Reggett he's interested in bringing commercial development to our community he's here with his architect mr. Beasley this evening and similarly they're well different circumstances but they're also requesting a setback variance to encourage the 10-foot setback easement outlined excuse me I've skipped ahead there to request
