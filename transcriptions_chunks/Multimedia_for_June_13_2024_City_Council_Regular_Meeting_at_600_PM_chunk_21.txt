concern. When you come, you have to have that full plan. So, not only drainage, but and I'll go back to the traffic. Back at Mr. Wilson's old house, is that apartment that's coming up right there? It's townhomes. Townhomes? How many? Do you remember? I understand, I believe. It's in our town. Ilizy Levin. I absolutely. So, that's going to add to the factor of traffic. So, my motion still stands. I do think we need more discussion. Mr. Ballgian, I do agree with you on that. I think it's all in the language. I do not want to see a multi-family development. Come back downtown until we put something in place in the conversation. Ms. Barriz and I has offered to help. I'm sure Mr. Gidry would offer to come in. Our residents are offering to come in and help and the Historical Committee. Okay. I think you all are agreeing on the same thing. Just want to point that out. I think everybody, I try to point it out. Except table, you know, there are some times in the law. One word means a great deal of difference. You have the word shall and the word may in the law. May means you could come back and try it, because that's possible. Shall means do not come back. That's why I asked our attorney the wording on table and denial. Because table means we may be given someone false hope. Denial means denied. And it also gives direction to our administration or anyone doing permitting, because I would be concerned that they would come to permitting and that word, if they would come with their plans for permit, that one word would have us caught up in a legal, in a legal tangle. So that's why I said motion to deny. Not table. I'll give my last call. Last word, that's all. I don't, I have Rude you. I do not want to see a multi-family development here. The reason I said table is because I didn't want to have to come, keep coming back so you could have just put a temporary, a temporary hold on development in the downtown district until you came up with the verb that you wanted to see, versus putting on more torium and then come back and changing on what you would like to see. So that's what I was saying. But I think we're clashing heads on the same topic that we agree. But somehow the script keeps getting sensationalized as if I'm wanting it here. But I don't. I'm just simply saying that let's do it right the first time and stop going there and coming back and changing the verb. It's because that's what we do with every ordinance. We change it to fit someone's narrative. Someone who comes in, they don't like it. You change it again. I think Miss Rae mentioned that in her speech. I was just wanting to get it done the right
