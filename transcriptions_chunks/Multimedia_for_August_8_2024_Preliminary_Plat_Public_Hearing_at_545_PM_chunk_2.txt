TND so we use five foot utility easements on the public roads. So just want to clarify that. So the TND ordinance will apply. Yes, that's all. Thank you. And that's referenced already. I guess Matt you said it. Yeah. On the letter, it isn't, but that's normally how we address it when we review it. So we can add it, but we tell them to show it, but we don't we don't say that it has to be the 10, but you are correct. But on the TND, we would always go by what the TND requirements are perfect. Okay. All right. Are there any council comments related to the proposed 10 C Sugar Mopon phase? Okay. Any misshump on. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you had a question. Okay. Any public comment any comment related to the proposed subdivision of property known as Sugar Mopon phase 10 C? All right. If there's no there's no comment on this, we'll adjourn the public hearing and then the council take action on it if they desire at the council meeting, which will start at 6 p.m. Thank you very much.
