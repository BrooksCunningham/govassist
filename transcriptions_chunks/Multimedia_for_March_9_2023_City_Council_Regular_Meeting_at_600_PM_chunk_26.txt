good road ahead of you and Uh, I can't think of anything anybody better to run for it. You do a great job behind the scenes of bridging gaps building you know the connection between people You've done that with three councils And uh you've done that in the community. So i think you're gonna we need that like the mayor said we need Someone who's sensible someone who connects with the public and someone who's there for the public not for themselves That has been the problem at a lot of our parachute level So good luck and i appreciate it. Thank you, man. Yep I mean i'm gonna have to do the math because i I used to i was taken pride that we would conduct all the business of the city one night a month and uh So that's only 12 Yeah, but i know and some of we had a lot of meetings in the earlier earlier years Yeah, I was counting the hours though because the hours once we had double That's true. That's true uh and there has been one in in just full disclosure I want to i do want to share that there has been a slate or maybe not slight but there has been a tweak To the Fortune alignment that i have not shared because it has just come up this last month As y'all saw our our preferred route was tugging our northern property line For the extent of the property until we met brusard We had been pretty far so we're coming you know straight like this Where brusard was you know coming well they They've asked us to make some changes Um To basically get us a little bit closer to where they don't have to So it's definitely not on the backyard like it was We wanted to go all the way to the end. They've asked us to come a little bit in so the um The more difficult design is on our part Um, I think we're up to the challenge. I was just uh, we were a little bit further in the plans than they were as we are doing the project today But at any rate so we'll get you the new copy of it Just so you can share it's um Um, I think to most eyes it would probably be minor because we were doing two lanes with the median And then you know they they this is how you're meeting us but they ask us is the kind of you know taper it So i'll share it just so Because as we're having conversations with residents you know and say well palms I did not know what you're what you just described All right Um, Mr. Voljana Yep Didn't think a hettle hole out but I guess I do um Teever vets at the parish fire association meeting tonight Uh, so sorry couldn't make it Uh on the screen.
