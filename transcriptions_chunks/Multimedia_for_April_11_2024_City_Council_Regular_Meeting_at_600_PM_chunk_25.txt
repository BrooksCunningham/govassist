as we were about BYYA and the strength of that program and that organization seeing where it is today is just it's it's a it's phenomenal works very proud of that the other thing I was this number continues to just catch my attention we have 6,800 kids that go to our schools between K to 12th grade within the city limits of Young'sville so if you add in the early education centers preschools daycares it's very easy to get over 80105 and what's 80105? 80105 was the complete census for the entire city here in 2010 so that's our population of just daycares and K through 12 students so just that may mean I don't know that made me really just have a moment of pause to realize people want to be here and whether it's about the parade or recreation or roads I mean that's that's the challenge that we face every day and that's how to scale this to make sure that we're being respectful to everybody that wants to be here and those of you that have lived here forever so thank you Tim Sarah I wouldn't expect in you but I'm happy to see you so the wastewater treatment plant upgrade received LDH permit and so we're just waiting on LDQ and fire marshal permitting and approval and the right study. Pump station 4 we received the LDH permit and we're awaiting the right study. The water plant as you said beds may first elevated storage tank received LDH approval and waterline interconnections also oh no that one we're awaiting LDH approval and the storage tank and waterline interconnections were waiting on the right study for the sugar melt pond pump station upgrade it's in progress and we're coordinating with the sugar melt pond engineer to determine the best route for the force of being and I think we did wait we got to the check you need for for the elevated storage tank okay so we we're moving a close and on that property yeah the check's been issued for the property and yeah the the water water plant opening on May 1st I think is definitely a critical path in our in our continued ability to grow so we're excited about that and then my last comment one of those pump station upgrades whether it's three or four I think we're gonna peel off of the DEQ funding and put that on its own contract for capital outlay okay because we have we had 500,000 from last year's capital outlay so I'd like to do have that just to I mean that's already bonded out and is ready so now that our facility planning guys given us all the green lights on Pam's projects we're gonna do this one so okay all right so thank you okay captain anything all right are there any any council announcements all right any other bit any other mr.
