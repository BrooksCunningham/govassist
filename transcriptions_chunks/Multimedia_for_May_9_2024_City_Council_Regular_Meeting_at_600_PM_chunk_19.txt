think I have it in about as best a posture as I can you know for your consideration um you know this evening this initially was not in our you know plan area you know of annexation um you know in order to get to our uh population build that that we did in our water modeling i think was really well as bi-demographer but i think it was really more focused on the inward building um but it is contiguous so it presents itself in a position you know that could be um you know suitable so that's where we are tonight councilman shampoen thank you mayor uh my question is so that the what we're going to vote on tonight as annexation is contingent upon meeting all the requirements that you have outlined yes with mr shamsi yes ma'am so the property as i appreciate it's under due diligence today um i think i've got it in the right posture that would be beneficial for the taxpayer of young zoda consider accepting the property um but yes that's correct i would agree so what what i'm asking you to do for consideration is to give mr shamsi a level of assurance that he can move forward you know with uh move forward with his due diligence of course he'll have to come back we'll have to go through the annexation process you know so it'll become back to you at at least twice to vote on it um because there are multiple parcels and things like that so you know it'll be it'll be a process to get it acquired into the city limits but we've discussed the the capital development fee structure the road betterment uh you know the requirement for fire protection water service um and we seem to be in a good you know a good good agreement with those variables at the appropriate time there if there aren't any other questions i'll move to favourable okay yes ma'am are there any uh council questions before yeah let me uh okay yes uh uh miss let's see which buzz in for me and i'll just get you on the all right thank you um yes so the the route of annex the route of annexation uh miss barez would be on the northern right here and might be easier for me just to show you okay like on the northern the northern frontage that's contiguous that is a shaman agriab is a city road between daton and guillot so um as a result it lends itself to be contiguous to be able to come down these parcels would be able to be annexed without accepting um daton or guillot daton daton and guillot are not city roads south of shaman agriab isn't been longmanese property annexed into that we're going to yes so i'm curious to him too okay yeah yeah so if it's touching is too then that would be yeah that would be
