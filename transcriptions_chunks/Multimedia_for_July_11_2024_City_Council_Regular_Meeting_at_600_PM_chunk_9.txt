draw the line is of course there's you know football teams out you know promoting their fundraising those that are seeking elective office so anyway just some thoughts to consider you know as it pertains to that for those that have reached out to us so I just wanted to let everybody know about the sweet summer shop hop that the chamber is going to be doing at the end of the month July 27th it's basically going to be some of our small businesses that are going to be offering deals and specials on that day so I'd like to encourage the community to come out you'll be able to pick up your bingo card at who you craft coffee between eight noon and then go out and shop at the local shops if you are a local business that's a member of the chamber it is free to participate we just ask that you offer some sort of special or deal for those that are coming in to your establishment that day and if you are not a member of the chamber but you have a local business it's $50 to participate and you can find more information on the chamber's website thanks hailey key flu beer thank you mayor one thing I wanted to go over and explain everybody I have some slides put together since I've been here in office one thing I've made priority mine is to find things that the police department was under utilizing or not utilizing at all something that came across I found that I implemented immediately so to explain everybody axon is the company that puts out our body cam supports our body cams we had a program through axon that we were paying for not pay for it was including the package that we weren't using it all it's called my 90 so our citizens are going to start seeing this I'm going to put out some information online so that people can see it there maybe press release so we can explain to our citizens what it is so what my 90 is is a survey platform the survey platform is attached to the calls that our police officers go on on a daily basis we were able to to narrow down the calls we wanted to send these surveys out for and the only things that we excluded from these surveys to be sent out to people is calls series in nature where we don't want to re- victimize anybody so basically generic calls that we go on every day so what happens is when someone calls 911 their calls goes into a database through our dispatcher system a lot of people know our dispatchers or dispatch by the Lafayette chair office which comes into play in this also once that calls dispatched out their phone numbers recorded these people can remain anonymous on the call not giving names the survey keeps them anonymous we never know
