built there. Yeah. So, I mean, we have our plans in place. It's just it would obviously be additional costs to go back to have them redrawn and a little time delay. Yeah, we I think it would be really great house. Oh, no, it's just we just looking forward to move forward with it. All right. Let's see Mr. Bolziana. Yeah. I'll make a motion with my constituents everything else to say. I can wait. Let me get you in, Miss Jean-Pine. Excuse me one second. Okay. Go ahead. Welcome. Welcome to young zoom. And the question's really this is the same as we did in the last at the last meeting correct is where we did it to and I believe right after this we're going to do a blanket. Correct. Is that is among the standard. Yes, ma'am. And I know I have learned a little bit about the way you know you think and I do appreciate that which is why we did recommend in conversations with the developer to let's just look at all of the corner in cul-de-sac lots. And for the public's benefit, I mean the intention of this ordinance initially, you know it's no secret we're growing rapidly resident with residential development. Some of our and we've to my point about continuous improvement learning from best practices and other parts of the country some of our some of the builders and developers that we have. The goal that we were what problem what we trying to solve was really one of getting vehicles off the road onto the driveways into garages. There are some builders that don't build the garage is large enough for vehicles to begin with. And so that presents a challenge where the garage is primarily being used for storage. It's certainly fine but then when you have the garage 20 feet from you know the road and you have vehicles you know on the on the driveway it makes it harder to enjoy the sidewalks you have more vehicles in the streets where a community of families and kids so you have kids that are out in the front and it makes it harder more challenging to navigate the roads. So I was just trying to break up you know the the monotony of going down a street and everything looking the same and everything being like on a straight line. So we have a development that we did where the setbacks were varied you know from 20 to 27 to kind of break that visual point up it appeared to work well. So that's why we pass the ordinance to say let's do the garages at 25. I think the opportunity that we have in the future I know that this particular development here is local builders that build build houses where you can actually utilize the garages. So that's why for me personally I don't see the issue here because it's local builders that use that
