to turn around happens all the time you pull into the driveway at the end there and you back up and you pull out. Typically we would put the driveway for the last house. And we're going to be building the houses. We put the driveway for the last house. Closes to the first. The in this case the northern property line. So you got enough room between the driveway. If you turn in there that driveway by actually having a clue to back out of that last lot and pull out. You're not at the back of the car. Yeah. I think I mean it. Yeah. I mean I think if they're through signage and I mean if it's an issue if nothing else. Yeah. I mean we're talking about four homes. I think in Chugamupon the example was about eight homes or so which I. If the longer the alley the more risk that you have that somebody may get lost. Sure. In this case you can actually head to the alley you can actually see the end of the alley. Yeah it's up to you guys. Mr. Nagle will you have a signage on those alleys like you. I'm sorry. Are you going to have signage on those alleys like you've talked about. I'll do whatever you want me to. I'll give you a name to the alleys I can put these green addresses is whatever you'll want me to do. There's a name for that. Yeah because these homes as well. I won't have street furniture. Yeah these are on these are on green spaces. Okay I think that's I think the council's heard enough. Of course because people that are driving that's the first house as they may turn just. Right. Not know. Like a no outlet type sign or. I think that you would take care of anybody as lost. Yeah. I'm certainly willing to do the signage. Perfect. Any other council comments related to Rosewalk. Okay continuing. Okay so we have some recommendations. I don't know. What's the recommended way they 14 which I agree with. We talked about. 16 which is the. How's this running on parks? I go to the IDRC comments. Same issue as number one. I don't think we need to do anything with it. 12 and 13 in the ADRC requires cross-access easements. These are in our town center commercial village. Pull up the layout. So they're requiring a cross-access easement between RC2 and RC1 into the southern or eastern western lots. It causes me a little hard burn because T&Ds are typically not interconnected with adjacent properties. I'm concerned about the money we're going to spend in the town center and having an easement into the property next door with no idea of what they're going to be doing with their property. But on the layout you'll see that we actually have parking in those areas. So we have parking where that connection will ultimately go. Again
