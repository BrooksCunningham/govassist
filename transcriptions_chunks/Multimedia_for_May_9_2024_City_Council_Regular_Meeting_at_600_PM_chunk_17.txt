architects and Latvian so and i'm working with uh Rusty Brissard from Raging Cation Construction he'll be our exclusive builder there so if anybody wants to build there by lots i have to go through Rusty so that's the plan on that subdivision yeah it's going to be a phenomenal development i mean we've been working on this for several several years forever um and and appreciate the partnership too because as part of this is also going to be land for our future fire department so we're we're thrilled to put that as well and that land donation to the cities coming with that plat yes sir so um what so let's go on to uh the 196 acres so we have under contract uh three different parcels and a total of approximately 196 acres bordered on shim and agriab uh Dante road and guillot so we border all three of those roadways so i've been working with the mayor and like the mayor said we're doing a lot of due diligence um there's a sizable roadway contribution that's expected from us we have a sizable cost in the lift station and a force main to the regional lift station so we're talking a million dollars there and then we're talking i i asked the mayor to have Suzanne do some modeling of the water system uh the way it's right now we're at 500 gallons a minute and the fire chief 170 the only way we're going to accomplish that is uh over sizing some of the mains coming down Dante road from the future elevated water storage so the subdivision across the street they didn't have to do any water main looping and you know i think there's a little short-sightedness on that development that's that they should have been required to do some but now it's all in our back so we're going to be extending the main along shimman all the way to uh to dante lakes and then once we develop the southerly portion we'll have to bring it all the way down Dante road and then the development there so that's another 400 600 thousand and the roadway improvements are about 750 thousand contribution has been requested on us and on top of that uh with the proposed development the way we have it approximately 600 homes another two million dollars and impact fees so you can see it's it's approaching five million dollars on this development and that's why we're trying to do all our due diligence up front try to give everything negotiated ahead of time because we never expect it to be this type of uh infrastructure improvement off site but we don't want to go and close on land that we're not for sure going to get annexed to the city because truthfully if it ain't coming in the youngsville the lands not work nothing to us right so you know kudos to the city of youngsville but that's
