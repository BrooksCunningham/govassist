know if I need to second mr. Boljana within a amendment to his motion are you okay with that provision I mean it would basically just be for this use of that that yeah well the miss champagne just asked she's willing to second the motion if it's just specific to this use of the old glory cost it I mean I just every yeah I'm not for like it's pretty uh I feel like it's pretty just specific in any way like that I mean this isn't like anything anybody else to do they would have to come back to do this anyway so I could say uh I feel like it's a special circumstance to begin with so I guess so yeah yeah and I'm just a little concerned about uh any type of variance I do know hey look cost fits wonderful I like cost fit I can't do it but I admire people that can it's very hard work but I do know they lead the garage doors open a lot of times outside on the exterior of the building so five a.m. in the morning if there's a lot of noise a lot of sound is what I'm that's why I was wondering if mr. coma would be here right and I'm okay with the variance as long as it only pertains to this cost fit gym right now the five foot variance if it if it moves over to another tenant they would have to come back to us for any or if it's sold if it's sold then I would think we would want them to meet the requirements of our ordinances in place now yes we don't do that for renters I don't believe I would go out and do that for renters correct the way the way the way we reviewed this this property um if the property is being sold um then our ask would that have become in compliance with with all of the standards that are in place at the time that the business is sold or that the property is sold because this one's simply a rental I mean we haven't imposed uh you know any any other requirements on that particular uh piece of property so I think right now the question is there was a motion to grant the variance I think you've you just need to decide I mean if you're doing a substitute motion or if you're willing if you're going to amend your motion no it's fine I'm good with this obviously you're good okay so you're willing you're seconding the motion okay mr. Romero um I know we when we property owners transfer ownership uh any variances that we've had in place fall out what about with rental I was looking under sign ordinance because not not trying to hamper this business body means I just didn't want them to go pop up in a sign that exceeds the traditional sign
