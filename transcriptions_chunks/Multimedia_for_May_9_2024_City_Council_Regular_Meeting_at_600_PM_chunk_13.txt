ordinance yeah uh I'd have to look at the measurements of this one again but that a cursory option remember it I feel like it was five or ten I feel like the monument sign met the requirement yeah um so but I would imagine that it may be a change of face on the song okay just something to keep in mind yeah miss champagne the monument sign really didn't meet all the criteria because but Craig mr.
