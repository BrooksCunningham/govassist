the nice the exciting part of this one is that um in that five point seven million dollars it will be a wet pond but they are also paying for some extra nature based solutions um so they definitely want to make it a inviting space for public and also uh things that bring in um whether whether it's birds or whatever so there'll be a lot of plantings and stuff so in that they've included um funding for us to be able to get um other consultants involved with regards to these nature based solutions um biological and of sorts so it's going to be different from our other ones um but it definitely will be before people ask it's wet this one will be wet um and that's pretty much the highlights of the main things less anybody has any questions questions for Pam you concerns thank you so much Susan um so with regard to the wastewater plant and the uh sewer pump station upgrade um we are waiting on the water sector rate study for that but in addition uh for the wastewater plant we applied for the DQ permit back in 2019 DQ and EPA went back and forth over some TMDL studies they finally worked it out then they came up with the new permit that we need to go through so we're going to apply for that but it is looking like we're going to have to add a couple of things one of which is probably post-arration to meet the dissolved oxygen in limits and we may have to put in filters we're hoping not but we'll know that when we get the permit so that's it for that the streetscape is complete except for those punch list items there's some back ordered things we're hoping they'll come in soon but we really don't know but um so for the most part that's complete with regard to the water plant the elevated storage tank the water line interconnections we're pretty much just waiting on that right study water sector rate study and permitting so that's it any questions anything okay yes sir a clink uh Susan to meet uh DHH's new requirement uh are we going to see a large uh cost increase with the sewer plant oh you can talk about DEQs okay so um what we plan to do with regard to the post-arration what we we're talking about is using one of the clarifiers that we were going to decommission and using that as for the post duration so we'd have to add some aerators in there but at least we wouldn't have to build a new structure there filters would be a different thing so what we might do is um if they give us interim limits we may wait and see if the SBIRs can meet those limits and then if we can't then we'll have to add in filters at a later date okay um I
