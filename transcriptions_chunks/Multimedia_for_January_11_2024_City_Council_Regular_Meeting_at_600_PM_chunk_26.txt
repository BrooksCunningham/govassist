I'm making a recommendation though with the motion that will go from 12 to 17 dollars for the additional cart which would be a five dollar difference you're looking at about 34 thousand dollars a year so I would like to make a motion if I'm my agenda on ordinance number 488-2024 to prove as is recommended with the change on item three solid waste additional cart to 17 dollars from 12 dollars all right thank you mr. Mayor um is there a second on his motion I'm just creating seconds the motion mr. created java comment man just just clarification of the roll from 23 to set to 27 oh I'm sorry on the uh I'm sorry 12 to 17 yeah one on the second caveat that was the only yeah from what was recommended to us by the administration and the mayor the only suggestion I had was going instead of 14 dollars from 12 to 17 so just an additional $3 on what they'd recommended okay and this is only going to affect people who have the second can correct you know pay a little bit more because you're getting additional usage that a way it's not affecting the people who just have one can correct paying the additional okay so right is there any council comment or any public comment any public comment yes yes ma'am we're not coming only so we can you can be on the audio miss Cox hi are you all accounting for the credit card fees that's associated with the payments for example if you know collecting $23 for waste management and the credit card fees are usually 3 to 5% is that yes part of the law that's happening that you're not accounting that in yeah that's a great question so uh so currently uh well let me let me answer it twofold so currently um if you pay in your utility bill uh with the city of youngsville um you're paying the the using a credit card you're paying just the um $23 or the you know what it's it's lumped in with water water sewer and garbage there's no convenience fee to pay with your credit card so that i'm taking a loss with that that's one of the that's noted as uh as an operational expense in the utility department we don't have that specifically charged back to sanitation but you can see that there is a charge there is credit card processing fee charge within the utility fund yeah yeah i know that hurts a lot of businesses with the credit card fees it does thank you yes great question is there any other public comment all right miss get your please call the vote all right all right um as is that ordinance will come back at the next meeting in February uh to be voted again for final adoption all right um council you have the staff reports in your packet i guess we
