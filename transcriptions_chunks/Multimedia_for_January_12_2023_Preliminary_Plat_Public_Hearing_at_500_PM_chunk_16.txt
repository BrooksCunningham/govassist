look like your ordinances actually driving how it's being designed and developed it went from conceptually being an outdoor storage unit to now an interior unit our interior design because of your direction regarding the amount of footprint that could be taken by this type of development there's a lot of green space around it because of I think there's a limitation of how much of the footprint could be used for storage so we really I mean this is a pretty simple subdivision of property just one line but in an effort to really just communicate what we anticipate happening there is really just why we wanted to bring this you can see the the green space it's really driven just because of your requirements about how much of a footprint could it take you know could it hold but the exterior for side so far I know there's been a couple iterations and conversations with Clint regarding this so is there any council comments related to the subdivision of property any public comment related to say ball. All right if there's none we'll go ahead and close the public hearing and we'll start the council minutes six o'clock so thank you very much public hearings adjourned.
