is going to be to construct a traffic improvement at press god And bone and riding the curve where the city has acquired the right away that corner property Um, we we believe we're well positioned Pam to have that fully paid by a grant with the exception of um engineering fees The crit okay, so Yeah, and then so that anchor there coupled with the full depth patching that we're addressing from this point towards city all um Arca has some traffic impact Fees that they're going to be addressing with this Um towards construction of this roundabout but now that we have this roundabout fully funded by grants We're looking to take those private impact fees To shift to the Anselm Cooley at the veterans park To to wind a mirror so we're we're working on it. You know there there are some sidewalks now A couple you know, you got a charlie's crossing you got that connect to um Dollar general and it just stops right so I think there's a just some opportunity that may be definitely go all the way down On one side and maybe do a crosswalk Okay, very dark down that road.

I think it's probably a little easier more open land On the other side it if there could be a cross or something like that. Yeah All right. Yeah, no, we still we we were committed to to getting it though Susan Yes As far as the waste water plant and the water plant those are in permitting
