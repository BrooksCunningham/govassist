for doing it right Matt you've been out there some of the council members have been out there I paid each of the contractors in advance something you don't normally do I don't normally do it but I had a good feeling and I was excited to get this building done I've got over $20,000 paid out and all I have is this slab but now after several months should have been in before Christmas yeah but I was following the process as soon as I saw what had happened I shut it down and I called the City of Youngsville the Home Owners Association and I called Angie and my rep in by the way you Jan the Angie at any opportunity they stood behind me they not only a band of this contractor I'm not gonna say who it is you probably some of you know who it is my now but he let me down and I trusted him for the permit because I had no experience with it in his words he says Wayne I'll take care of it I do this all the time and when I came home from work three or four days later after I wrote the check and committed okay everything was poured as you mentioned earlier and I shut it down and I said did you get the permit that quick he said no I didn't have a chance to do that but I wanted to pour this slab before the heavy rains moved down I started bleeding through the ears you know and I lost it and I told I just told them to leave my property and of course I contacted all the necessary people but I have matching shingles 30-year shingles that I prepaid for and $15, $1800 worth of shingles you saw the pallet in the front yard and I've got the paint to go with it I did all the necessary things I needed to do to do it right you know and I'm gonna stucco it if you folks approve it or I'm eventually gonna stucco it to match my home so I'm doing it right sure I just want to make that clear because I just want to point out I know he's drawing does say six feet so I asked Garrett about that there's two fences behind his property the six foot goes to his wooden fence there's another property line of another two feet so that's so it is a two foot variance we are making not even that is the same sense the same I just want to in case this comes up when he does his permit if we approve sure to make sure everybody's on same page and keep in mind if you folks will approve this for me and answer my prayers I'm willing to sign a statement and put it on file I'm not going anywhere after 26 years I'm vested in Youngsville so if and
