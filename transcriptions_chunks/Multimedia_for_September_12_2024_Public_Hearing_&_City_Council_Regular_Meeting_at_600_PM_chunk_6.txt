Come on up, Susan. Hi there. So we received four bids. That seems to be our magic number recently. Four bids. The estimate was 380,000. Three of those bids came in below that. The low bid was southern constructors for a base bid of 323,000. This is the pump station on Young Street. That southern trail is just going to come to. All right. Any comments or questions from the council? We'll take a motion to accept the low bid. All right. Miss Champagne motions to accept the low bid. Is there a second? Second. By Councilman Volgiano.
