pond events and hopefully in the future the Beverly go to sports complex it relieves a little bit of parking understand their safety concerns with that but I just wanted to speak on that and I appreciate you time well thanks thanks David actually coincidentally he came and talked to me after this was introduced had no idea no idea no idea was introduced but when he started I don't even know if I knew why you were coming but as he started talking I had he's just paper here and said y'all I've already talked about it on the 8th I'm like wow that's that's amazing you know so you know but just wanted to see if it'd be possible in the future to take it to the next level where we're not ending up with you know we have I don't know how many golf carts we have registered in Youngsville but I know in our neighborhood there's probably at least 50 to 60 so now all of a sudden those become low speed vehicles and now they're riding in the lane of traffic when really all they wanted to do is cross yeah so appreciate you time I appreciate it thanks David thank you I mean just I don't know if you'll need to is there any other public comment I guess I should ask for okay mr. Mara I appreciate you getting up I did not ask him to come talk by the way you're speaking my language I've been talking about this for probably six months or so it's right now it's essentially baby steps we've removed the slow moving vehicles now the problem with the crosswalk which was something I brought up our CAO and even our city engineer there's state laws that require where it's at so there's no true area either on 92 or even on shim and mediree where it can go to cross that that's one of the problems we're seeing I do think we're gonna see an uptick in slow moving vehicles over the next year which I by the way it's gonna be put out there that's okay hopefully and from the safety standpoint that be okay and maybe we'll be revisiting this in another six months to years well because I agree with you there are people off the St. Belays that are crossing shim and mediree to Ernest Gullets drive through going into Laurel Grove even and coming up to Yalls neighborhood I know a lot of them so I get it and it's only gonna increase as we expand the roads too. Yeah so just just for the I guess the public's knowledge if you haven't been following this particular issue this ordinance has been in place now for 10 years with this amendment to the ordinance is set to do should it pass this evening the ordinance from 10 years ago really manages slow moving vehicles and golf carts together as one so what
