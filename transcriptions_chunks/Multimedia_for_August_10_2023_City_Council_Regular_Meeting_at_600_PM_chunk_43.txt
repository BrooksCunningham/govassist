We have two things coming up in September and October. Some fundraisers. We mentioned them in the past where we're given scholarships away to our bright students. And we're also including tech schools. So it's not just a four-year degree. We're including others. And then also community grants. So this these fundraisers that we're about to do. One in September, one in October. Will be for those fund for those items. This year, the September one is a little unique. We're actually partnering up with the chamber for auction online. And they're actually going to go around different days and visit the businesses in Youngsville. That are donating items. Go Facebook Live, do the auction live. So it's really a nice little hybrid approach. I'm looking forward to it. That's going to be September. Okay. Thank you. And that's all I have. So check it out. All right. Thank you, Jessica. Thank you, Mr. Stansbury, Ms. Shumpan. Thank you, Mayor. I'd also like to congratulate Councilman Stansbury for offering to run and get qualified today for this seat. It's a very instrumental seat. It's very important to our area. So I wish you luck and thank you for doing that. I also would like to congratulate everyone out there that has run and qualified to run for office. I thank you for wanting to put yourself out there and you're committed to public service. So I want to thank you and congratulate every one of you that have qualified to run for public service.
