then other things but a fence to maker and jb Mootunner doing a great job with it and we're still looking at opportunities to continue driving the cost further down By self-performing some of the work and removing the administrative overhead from jb Mootunscope just to kind of give you an example So really just wanted to provide an update for you guys. I'm happy to Answer any questions or concerns that you may have about it before I move forward How much smaller is the stage compared to where we originally were or in the and where we where we have done rated to is there still I guess we're on the weekend. I was expanding the stage to where we originally had the plan or is it going to be That's the sauce forever Well you You may be recalling something else now. I think it is that number six basically like that the smaller stage the biggest stage to the right is has the blue Yeah, never so that's a 16 that the smaller stage is removed from this Just to just to i'm sorry because you just jog my memory So basically from the conception building which is in the center of the pavilion you basically have a clear line of sight You know walking into the amphitheater area What was proposed before was that there was a smaller stage number 16 where the cursor is The y'all does anybody the overmember the sizing of that of the stage or what we what that looks like there Let me see I can provide a I may not have brought all my I Think what happened is the stage itself the size of the stage stays the same but the external leaves the buildings to decide A win-away I think there was a maintenance or access the maintenance. Okay, so the stage itself So the stage itself is a separate the original song. Yeah, yeah Well, I guess about yeah because I was being honest. I think we had eliminated the size of the original stage that if there was an event No, it's that's an excellent question and I think if I'm not mistaken We put we position ourselves where it could still be expanded upon we were mute we removed maintenance buildings and any ancillary things Because of the proximity to the new Storage and maintenance buildings at foster park really being just you know just behind this area But yes, that that is correct. Yeah, the footprint the same to be expandable We had some earlier iterations where we was built out Buildings there kind of performance rooms, you know, I mean we were dreaming big about it I think everything that is proposed an original plan all your Electrical stuff out anything that Infrastructure is gonna be a place is just and then you'll be able to come in phases That Okay, and then the wall that we had talked about that's emitted.
