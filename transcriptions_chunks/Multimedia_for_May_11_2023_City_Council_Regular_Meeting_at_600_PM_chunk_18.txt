we haven't talked very much about but it is worth mentioning is that I did sign a design contract for Prescott and Bonan for the roundabout there. As you know last May we acquired the property to do the roundabout there. We appear to be successful in capital outlay to have funding for that project and then we have a secondary, well I don't know who's on first step, we have a secondary source teed up with some DOTD credit to construct the roundabout next to Dewey's lounge so that will, you know, the kind of awkward curve on Bonan so we would be able to the cities acquired the rounded dome there. So that building will, you know, be demoed in the near future and looking forward to having a project kick off there. And the Riviera Road is something that we haven't really talked too much about. North Riviera we know it's been taking a beating from all the heavy trucks but just to, you know, South Riviera Road has had such a, you know, guys you remember back in 2017, Southside High School was opening very quickly. That was a, you know, a substandard, deplorable road. It really was a lot of local traffic on it. Last four, there's a school there where we're rushing to get water and utilities there. We knew the condition of South Riviera was really important shape. 2200 feet of it was unincorporated. Funding was limited, et cetera, et cetera. So in 2019, some of you will remember we did go in and do a temporary fix which anticipated to be a five year design life. But in addition to that in 2017, Pam applied for a grant for us which was a 75% construction cost paid federal funds that are handled through the, then MPO here. So those are the plans she's talking about that are finally in review at the state. What does this mean to you? What it means is that South Riviera Road between Shimmy Metery and the flashing red light 19 feet wide today. It's the design is increasing that 19 feet to 24 feet wide. Curving gutter, so closing the roadside ditches. And if you've been here a minute, you know that where the La Salle Cooley crosses near the flashing red light, the La Salle Cooley overflows its banks. So now that the water has someplace to go with the La Salle detention ponds, part of this is going to be upsizing the box culverts and a new bridge elevated. So that is really exciting. We've not really, I mean, since the day we did the grant application back in 2017, it's been a long, you know, a route to here. But anyway, long story short, that project we're expecting to have under construction next year. And the local taxpayer, young's will taxpayer is paying 25% of that project. So not only is the water having someplace to go, the roads being redesigned with the
