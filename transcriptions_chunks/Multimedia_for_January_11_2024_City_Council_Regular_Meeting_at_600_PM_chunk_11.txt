everyone should be on notice that. I mean we can't continue to fund you know helping our brothers and sisters in the parish. I think they'll and I'm confident that our new parish council administration are really going to take a you know concerted look at is this a service at the unincorporated area would like. And I don't I don't have frankly an opinion on it. I think I have an opinion on they need to be communicated to and a decision at the appropriate level needs to be made to know that the other the other variable here would be I think it's 42 or 42 and a half percent of our property tax is automatically or marked for our fire department. So you know some of the improvements that that you've authorized the new apparatus I think it was two or three new apparatus in probably three years two years three apparatus is this is just rough numbers. I mean we've agreed to incur you know that you know that 10 year payment that debt for that 10 year payment. The expectation is that the property tax will be climbing you know every year so then at that case you know the the reliance on the other funding sources would need to be you know as heavy as we see the property tax just worth noting we have not received any property tax yet. I mean we know that the parish sent them out late you know that's been well reported but you know I'm sure that just from how I know I've received my property tax it was later you know payments are being made later so I think everything's just pushed back there so that is the silver lining here with fires that I'm hopeful that I mean we're if we're servicing what does that say like 300 more you know 300 more you know water customers on a similar amount of 300 more sewer customers you know logic would tell you that that's also 300 homes that are paying a property tax to where we should see the property tax contribution increasing as well so I think it's fair to say that more more come in you know in this story it'll be it'll be unfolding this year but as we just pointed out we're spending mayor 2.2 million dollars for fire and based on what you just said like property taxes we're bringing in about 600 thousand maybe 650 relative to fire that's earmarked for far so we've got a big gap there and so something needs to happen so that that gap can hopefully close and be hopefully eliminated down the road but anyway we're hopefully something will happen streets and drainage we budgeted 2 million 2.94 we actually spent 2 million 2.43 51 thousand less than we thought utility fun expenses Brad just talked about it you had budgeted 7 million 2.43 you actually spent 7 million 2.39 4.700 less than
