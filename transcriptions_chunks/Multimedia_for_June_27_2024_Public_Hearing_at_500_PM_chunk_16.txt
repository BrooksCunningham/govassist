dollars and then a projected this year three point eight million dollars so I echo what he's saying that there are a lot of large numbers here but they're funded largely by federal grants by state grants by a lot of planning and a lot of relationships that have taken I mean LaRivia road was probably a 2017 project the Fortune Road pavement preservation program you know arguably Fortune Road really does and need to be overlaid this is probably this is between the Bonan Roundabout and Youngsoe Highway but we applied for probably six years ago so we'll receive it if right 2015 so it's a preservation program we're 75% of that overlay is being paid for by the Fed so we're trying to get our major roads on that type of program where we're tapping into those type of resources you know to where we'll be set in a good scenario for continuous maintenance and improvement while still being able to deliver you know operational surpluses that aren't affecting the taxpayers and the Highway 89 expansion and widening and so on is that is that that funding from Youngsoeville some from Brussard and some from LCG so it's a it's a because that road you know it goes through all three jurisdictions where each managing our own section I think Brussard's actually doing a cooperative agreement to do LCG's portion while they're there and they get reimbursed for yeah now I mean our section is I mean we're managing it ourselves 75% of it's paid for by the state we have more design and we have funding because even though it's passed through the HB2 the state capital outlay bill now the hurdle is to get it through the state bond commission and then as they release money through the state bond commission we'll release additional plan sheets so the work hopefully will be contiguous so I think that I mean you know our portion roughly from like heart to farm you know come all the way to new news eventually the Brussard and LCG I think still have to work through the hurdles of getting the road from the state which you know I hope I wish them better luck than we had because it's our road it's our local road so we're we are in complete control of it now which is why we're able to it's finally moving well what you have to maintain it once it's finally controlled yes and when we took the road over for for the main section of like Russo Road to new news we received three million dollars in credits so that's the monopoly credits I've talked about like how do we use them where do we spend them and the best place that we've been well the only place we've been allowed to apply them is on Larivier Road because we've been we've been able to put it as a match on that road which is a significant
