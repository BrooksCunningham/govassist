know the the the ownership did comply with that um you know just pointing out I mean though that when you look at the building I think it was the desire they want at the time to to do all metal when you look at the middle from the exterior even though it's a different material it's still really you have to be really on it to realize that it's a difference of you know hearty plank and hearty plank and metal the concern here that you review and in your packet is that this is there now that they've had the opportunity to have it's been about two years that you've been open roughly they're seeing how the materials the hearty planks wearing and their cognizant of the fact that moving forward with the self storage facility there's a lot more potential wear and tear people moving in and out hence the reason that they're offering that I think they understand the spirit of the ordinance because that's why the the request is not to you know do metal um takes more metal but they they're recommending a substitute product for the application that they have Mr. Bulljohn yes I'm pretty well versed in the material itself but do we have any current businesses in our city or in the area that they currently use this on their facility just for reference watch is talking about seeing the pan no we don't that's why we requested that they'd go to a variance because it wasn't allowed I'm not saying that it can't be but no we don't have anybody and we haven't really had any requests by anybody to use this material so it's not that we just have not that request we just have hearty plank like a conor people just go with stuck or hearty plank or brick or whatever so they don't they don't even research for this type I mean there's vinyl and then there's you know this is a higher grade so nobody really has ever come to us with the research according to so that's why we recommended bringing it and if it's something that you guys in the future want to take a look at once you know if you should approve it and you take a look at it and you like it then it may be something to consider in the ordinance but right now we just didn't have an opportunity to do it on our level okay thank you okay oh the other quite Mr. Bruce you're certainly welcome to address the council or I know you would answer any questions should they have any I'm not sure that I'm seeing any at this time Mr. Romero Mr. Bruce are you doing okay I'm going great great oh just one question are you going with the same colors scheme and everything okay I thank you very much all right Mr. Paul John if everyone's been at grants I'm like
