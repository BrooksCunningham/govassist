next to it to make it more inviting of a park. I do have another development on fourth street. So I really like this area. Care about property values. Intentional about design and what I'm going to put here. And as far as the ordinance that I'm asking for, one of them, which is the density aspect, essentially asking for three more than what's allowed currently. And with these cottages, it's more of a softer density. Currently, as it sits, I could put five rows of five townhomes. This eight unit cottage court is basically less of an impact on the environment as far as the floor. Floor area ratio, which is basically you take in the building footprint and in relation to the lot size. So it's a lot less of an impact. And again, we think there's a huge demand for something like this, a lot of empty nesters. And unfortunately, the voice rates high around here. So there's a lot of people that they don't need a big house. It could just be one person that would live in there, which is why there's not many one bedroom opportunities or two bedroom small homes like this. You know, a lot of people think because they're so tight, there's there's not much privacy, but you know, privacy is not gained. It's not, privacy is gained by design, not distance. So we're really intentional about how we put our window placement, you know, open side faces a close side of the next unit. There's what's called landscape layering where you have porches, sidewalks, picket fences, all in between houses in the common area. So we're real intentional about that. And again, I think this type of development with the cottage is harmonious with the surrounding area. There's a lot of smaller homes in this older port of Royville. So I think it's a good little, you know, I think it would be great for this type of location. We do have a lot of green space. I think the current concept we put together was like over 44% green space. And again, the HWA will maintain the common area. We'll probably add some amenities. And any questions, I'll open it up to you guys. Yeah, see Mr. Romero. Hey Matt, how you doing? Yeah. Good. Hey, we got a list of the, you know, variances in order. So I'd take one by one if you don't mind. Sure. And if anybody wants to say anything, obviously. Sure. So density wise, I don't want to make sure I'm on the right page here. So technically it should be how many units, Pam? What are they're proposing eight units? Five. So we're three. But then for the acres, yes. Okay. So the setback, I'm assuming the parking is on Port Street? Correct. Because the way I was looking at the dog grams, I couldn't figure that out as I could. Yeah, it's, and we have the dog room to pull up
