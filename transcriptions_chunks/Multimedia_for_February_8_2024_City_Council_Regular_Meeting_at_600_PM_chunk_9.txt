all right hearing no mischidry please call for the vote all in favor motion approved all right thank you council we'll go ahead and move into staff announcements Susan since we were talking about water you want to maybe to to yourself to start that conversation perhaps so we're in the process of doing some changes to the water treatment plant designed to decrease the size of the building and and take away some architect architectural features to kind of decrease the cost of the the project and so we've asked for an extension to go to bed on this job and we're just awaiting the water sector committee approving that the rest of it we're looking at some changes for the the upgrade of pump station for on Iberia Street how we can reduce the cost of that as well as the wastewater treatment plant upgrade you know trying to save some money where we can there and the rest of it we're working on the Sugar Mill Pond upgrade which will involve a new force main apparel all force main to the existing force main so we're working with Robert Dagle and those people to site where that new force main will go and then we'll design the pump station upgrade so that's all in the works okay so any questions for Susan relative to her report all right will we appreciate it I know that we appreciate you working with us to control the cost a minute it's no surprise to everyone the cost of construction has gone up you know considerably over the last couple of years so even though we've been in plans and in planning and design for several years on our new water treatment facility we really felt it was incumbent upon us to really scrub the design the best that we could small lower the footprint and really reassess what those needs were for the water treatment plant for the public's benefit I know I've told the council is aware of this but our water treatment plan when we do go out to bed which now we've asked for an extension to the end of March the benefit of our water treatment plan is that it will quadruple our daily production of water the idea is that it'll lessen our dependency on our LUS wholesale water purchases the majority of us in this room and the majority of our residents are LUS wholesale water customers since the master city's master plan and before that time we've known that in order to continue growing that we would have to make some decisions relative to water and the decisions that were made was to continue drilling wells which we've just completed our third one those enable us to produce more water with quadruple in our daily production our goal is to lower the currently 1.3 million gallons of water that we're purchasing wholesale today and increase the 220,000 gallons of water that we're making
