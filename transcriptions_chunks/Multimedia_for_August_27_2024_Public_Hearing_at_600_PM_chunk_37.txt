next to someone's home. They don't have coffee shops on the next block out of Chigamil Pond. They don't have hamburger joints in Fairfield or whatever other neighborhoods. That's not what it is.

We don't want a nightclub banging speakers to a clock in the morning. But hold some community neighborhood business.
