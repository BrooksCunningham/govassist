for last year as he just went over the sports complex and the utility fund and those two account for approximately of the total expenditures they account for about $12 million of the total expenditures of the city but your total operational expenditures exclusive of capital outlay but it does include debt service is about 30 million so this is about 12 but what I'm going to do is take everything but those those 12 he's already talked about so let's go to page one and at page one of the handout is going to be the overall totals compared to the budget that you had that you finally adopted the final amended budget for last year ending June of of 23. Everybody's got that first page. Okay okay first line item is the tax revenues and the tax revenues are include the advolume taxes franchise taxes and of course sales taxes which is the big driver here is the sales tax so total budget was 18 million 653 thousand dollars you actually brought in 300 thousand more than that at 18 million nine seventy four. And this is an increase over the prior year in sales tax just sales tax alone of about 5.3%. Now 5.3% for 2023 over 22 but 22 over 21 was a 16% increase and 21 over 20 was a 17.8% increase. You don't see that here I just have those numbers available. I just wanted to point that out we've had two phenomenal years prior to 23 with the increase and 23 is good at 5.3 but when you coming off 15 or 16 and 18% it is quite a bit less. So anyway that's the situation on the tax revenues so of the 18.7 nine million dollars of revenues 16.4 million dollars is sales tax. So 16.5 million you can say of the 18.9 million is sales taxes and the balance of about 2.5 million is advolume and franchise. Okay the next line item is the licenses and permits and here we had budgeted 1,336,000 came in significantly less than that at 981,000 last year that number was a million 546. The intergovernmental revenues here we budgeted 10,884,000 it came in at 9,379,000 last year was only a million 738. What's in that 9.7 million is a couple of big drivers here is some grant monies which is primarily for streets which was about 5.1 million in there and the ARPA monies will recognize this year. You had some that was spent on this complex and also some that was recognized as a replacement of loss revenues which you were eligible to do. Total ARPA monies was 3.4 million so included in the 9.4 million dollars that is 8.5 million dollars which is ARPA monies and mainly federal grant monies. So those two items but generally you're around the 800,000 in the intergovernmental revenues that come into the city. So we're going to get to that just a minute and we're going to
