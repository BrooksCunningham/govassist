thank you so that's now a young zool road we wanted we were doing young zool highway with capital outlay so we want to use those credits on another project within the city but it has to go through so many hurdles with the state in our argument is that we took it it's a city road it's our project let us do with it how we want so we were we met with representative Jacob Landry before he was already before he was sworn in just to get him up to speed on it Senator Kusonspin very knowledgeable understanding and of course as representative Boye and also our local DO TD office you know so we're trying our best to unlock those credits to apply to cash on the prod on 89 so that way it'll continuously work even if that credit is unlocked for an overlay from fortune like south to 89 because let's face it as that roads rebuilt you know you still the existing two lanes could be rebuilt could be overlaid with it if they advance if they convert those credits to cash and the administration has the ability to do it so that's what we're that's trying that's what we're leveraging and we haven't stopped design because the good part about if we were doing this design bid build you we wouldn't be at 100 percent plans but we're at 90 percent plans on fortune and we're pat beyond 60 percent plans on 89 so the contractors been given several rounds of plans and has given us prices all along so we're in a great position that while you haven't seen the construction we're still moving forward on all the other stuff the getting the the approvals moving utilities and things like that if we'd have given everything to the contract he still would have been waiting for all these utilities to get moved so like I said I think you're going to gain some traction on your timing because he's just going to have that much more information and that much more the utility things that were getting out the way while we're waiting on all of this so we didn't stop trying you know the whole time we were looking at what can we do and what can we get out of the way so that when he gets in there it's just done and you I mean it took months first just to get that poll and the AT&T stuff so a lot of people might not have seen it but he never would have been able to start out that roundabout because of that one poll that he used to have all the police cameras on so that that was several months to get that done and to get the AT&T line moved out the way and then several months working with enterprise typically a gas company will tell you it takes six months to get a permit from them
