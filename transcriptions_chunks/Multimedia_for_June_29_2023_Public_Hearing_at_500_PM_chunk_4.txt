through loans, issuance of bonds, and some city funds. So any questions on these two particular pages, and again, these items are worked into the budget document for next fiscal year, beginning July the 1st. Hearing no questions, I'm going to turn it over to my son Brad. He'll go over the utility operations as well as the park operations, and then we'll conclude, as I said, once Brad has completed it. Thank you, Burton. Good evening, Mayor, Council Public. Let's go take a look at the utility fund operations. We'll go through each department, and then we'll hit the totals as a whole. So those individual departments, page 21, page 21. As my dad did, whenever he did his presentation, he hit the highest spot, so I'm going to do the same thing for mine. Obviously, if you have anything like in the past, go ahead and stop me, and I'll do my best to answer the questions. We'll go through the totals, which is on 19. So let's go to 21. We'll take a look at water toward the middle of the page, and you can see the revenues in 2022 actual number 3.6 million, and in 2023, we're projecting about 4.4 million, and an increase to 4.9 million for the budget year. So healthy increases in the revenues, as my dad mentioned, and the budget message is tied to an increase in number of customers for 24, as well as to the CPI index. Expanditures for 22 come in at 3.3 million, which generated a profit of almost $300,000, a little less than at 293. For the current year, we're expecting expenses about 3.9 million, and to have a net income of give or take $550,000, and then for the budget year, expenses coming in about 4.5 million, and an income of $380,000. So in water, I mean, you have expenditures are going up, but revenues are keeping pace with it, and you have net income operational all three years. To me, that's what you want to see. Moving on to Suez, it's going to be a similar story. You can see for Suez Department of 2022, we have revenues of 2.2 million, increased into 2.7 in 2023, and then up to a little over $3 million for the budget year. Expanditures track similarly, in 2022, we had expenditures of 1.9 million, and that generated a profit of $335,000. For this year, we expect to have expenditures a little bit less than that, at 1.7 million, and a profit of $800 million, and $998,000. And then for the budget year, expect expenditures to stay relatively similar to 2023, at 1.7 million, and to have a profit of 1.347 within the Suez Department. Any questions about water or sewer? Moving on to sanitation, not as much to talk about here. I mean, you basically kind of have your revenues, and then you kind of pass on that cost and generate a little bit of a profit. In 2022,
