$350 to $600 just it is it is a big jump but I will say this when we first started as a civil service board we really had no idea what to pay somebody and it was kind of suggested this is a minimum but you can pay them whatever you feel like you need to pay them we at the time didn't have a whole lot of things going on it was most of a paperwork thing and Sally actually did it at first and then Laurie came on board and just kind of assumed that role at the promise of what we promise to pay her over the last couple of years she has put in numerous hours in preparing documents taking emails making phone calls preparing things for our meetings and I am talking about books of things that were just relevant to whatever we were hearing at the time we are volunteers it's not something that we can do we are totally dependent on a capable person who can prepare those documents for us to take those phone calls to write those letters that I saw because I don't have time to do it so she has been just on board with everything even at the $350 a month she has spent numerous hours after hours because this is not anything she does during her work day these are things she does after work or on the weekends or at home after hours or before work preparing documents for us and I just feel like she needs to be compensated for that and I'm going to ask her to stand up so y'all can recognize her because Laurie is a great employee of the police department and also a great asset to our civil service board. Ever complains she never has an opinion she just does what she's supposed to do and which is in a leadership role is what I expect and what I appreciate absolutely so do y'all have any questions to be on that. Did you have a chance to look at other civil service boards and what they're paying did you see that? They're paying around this wage around $600 a month for what I understand and actually by the time Sally left she was getting about $600 a month so yeah it's not unusual $350 is I mean if you're just pushing papers $350 is adequate but when you're documenting when you're preparing documents when you're talking to attorneys when you're doing the emails and all the communication between all of us it really becomes very cumbersome. So okay thank you thank you. Oh and this is actually if y'all need a copy of this these are all of the hours that she spent all of time over the last this is 2022 to now so this just in the last year and it's about 10 pages so just to document the time that she's spent doing this so okay anything
