park is open now perfect all right thank you Tim Germany do you have anything that Pam asked you to yeah I can just go over the projects real quick highway 89 the contractors ordering pipe and building the drainage structures on the fortune road around about the contractor is wrapping up the excavation associated with the detention pond he'll be constructing outfall pipe and installing the drainage pipe and catch basin in the next few weeks then working at the then beginning work on the roadway base shaman agriab as the mayor mentioned we submitted a new option to him to move forward and hopefully we move forward with the praise of property highway 92 in Prescott we're moving forward with the designs and plans preparation on the 2024 roadway improvements project we plan to advertise for bids on May 30th and this was this would allow us to take bids on June 27th regarding the FEMA CAV response we're working on the FEMA modeling on I believe LaSalle Cooley and doing the mapping we're currently working on the LWI and on Cooley project we are planning submitting the H&H study this month requiring permission to do geotechnical investigations and the archeological dig for the preferred site currently working on plans and specs and those are roughly 30% complete and I think that's it. Do you mention LaRivier? I did not that was submitted she's left that one off the list yeah that's okay. LaRivier was submitted to DOTD and I know they're currently looking at it. Yeah so just for everyone's benefit we've been working and that's a grant we're working on that project for a long time but South of Rivier will be from Shimon Metery all the way to the Flashtrain Red Light it's a very exciting project I think it'll be transformational as a North South corridor force it's in it's ready really DOTD's doing one more set of reviews on it and they'll be ready to go to bid the opinion of probable cost is over what DOTD had budgeted as well as we did but we're looking at potentially this may be a place that we can utilize our outstanding credits to where we won't have to come out of pocket any of it that project is moving taking the existing two nine foot lanes and creating two 12 foot lanes closing in the ditches making a curbing gutter raising the road particularly where it crosses the LaSalle Cooley crossing near the Flashtrain Red Light and installs a sidewalk I believe from investment all the way to Southside or maybe even a Shimon Metery I don't recall but it's really a great project the price unfortunately is ballooned to just shive nine million dollars so that's that is a real main event and the one one projects that aren't covered Neil Shafers report says really there's no action Neil Shafers there's two projects that they were assigned with I'll just cover them quickly
