a setback variance as well as a variance to the land use regulations as requested in the attached letter for a strip mall located at 615 Lafayette Street they Pam's joined me with my meeting but they've also Pam's also met with mr. Reggett in his group on at least one occasion previous to that council their request is in front of you what they're really looking for this this subject property if you're looking at family dollar on young zohaway this is just to the right of it it's been on the market for a while and it backs up arts in front of excuse me toy box storage which is a rear storage for outdoor storage facility and Pam and I really sat with him to work with him to try to get the maximize the usable space so that way we can have a nice product into commerce as soon as possible so happy to answer any questions as I mentioned the the the developers here but I think it's teed up for you pretty good in the in the council packet if you have any questions absolutely mr.
