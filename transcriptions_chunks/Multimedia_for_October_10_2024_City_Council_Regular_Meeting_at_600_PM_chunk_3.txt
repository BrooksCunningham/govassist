the asphalt that helps with friction. It's similar to like Kevlar, you have in Kevlar, if I ask, they call it a fiber. And it adds only on the top layer, it's a little bit more expensive, like 10% more. So you talk about $10 or $15 more. I think we figured out it was like a $10,000 total additional cost to add this fiber, which is really not in the grand scheme of things compared to going to concrete, which is hundreds of thousands of dollars more. So what we're asking here, and what we put in the cost estimate you're going to have in the front, the total ask on this change order is 198,000 that also includes, we did have to do some repair to a couple of spots before we did the asphalt on Valesco because we had some bad material in the native soils. So we had to do some additional stabilization. So with that, and the difference in the roundabout, the change order would be 198,000 to get something more permanent and to put this roundabout in the same typical section that is removing all limestone with all those extents that you have. And basically repair it to the same way we did the rest of the road, which is holding up a lot more than the original one. And just, again, to remind people, this roundabout has been open for almost 14 years with the design life on that typical section that was less than that. So it's done well, it's performed well, considering all of the traffic from a standpoint of construction and the 18-wilters we now have with this building that is the grocery store and a gas station. So I think this typical section, it'd be much like what we did when we're waiting on funding for La Rivier and Bona and others and then just making something that's gonna hold up a little bit longer. So that's our recommendation. So, well, I'll pause to see if any questions. So what we were, I mean, Pam's exactly right. What we were doing, we have intentionally really delayed more permanent repairs to the center section because we were seeking grant funding for a complete rebuild. Our 2022 transportation plan show that we would have a double lane roundabout there. Well, Pam's exactly right. I mean, La Rivier, we had to do a, you know, an interim solution to get to where we're, at the end of this year, bidding out the permanent solution on La Rivier. I think right now, the earliest time that we would have additional funding from the state to be able to move forward on this would at the earliest be this time next year. And I just, of the opinion that this intersection really shouldn't, it's lasted 14 years. But rebuilding it today to the same section that is on shim and mettery that was built in 2015, I think will give us the appropriate amount
