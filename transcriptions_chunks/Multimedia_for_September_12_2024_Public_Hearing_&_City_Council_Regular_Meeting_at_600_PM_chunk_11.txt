to offer an amendment to the ordinance that is put before the council I'd just like to have a provision added that would read and would be coincide with rather the state statute which requires that any golf court that is operated on a municipal street have the same liability insurance or with the same minimum limits as required by the state statute which is title 32 900 B and this would make it identical to the state statute which is codified it revised statute 32 colon 29.4 okay thank you sir mclogg I guess we should vote on the we have discussion you want to vote on the amendment first or okay okay is there a motion and second on the amendment first we'll do go that right okay motion by mr. champagne in a second by miss bar is okay is there any discussion we're just going to discuss the amendment first I thought we had something in here about insurance some permanent fund it because don't you require it when don goes out to do these meetings yes yes insurance is yes it is so what but this amendment makes our ordinance compatible with or read almost identical to the state statute it doesn't create a conflict so right now you're saying our insurance statement in here it creates conflict no what I'm saying is I don't think you're sure statute reach the same as the state statute so I just want to make them identical marry each other okay so the so the amendment is really just a kind of like a house key to the item that we that's all we really had we caught it soon or we would have just included it in the in the introductory item okay so okay is there any other is there any discussion this is just on the amendment which is clarifying the insurance language to bring that current okay if there's no public comment miss gager please call the vote on the amendment or marrow yes miss cre yes miss champagne yes miss bar is yes mr.
