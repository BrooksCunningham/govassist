assets of the city were 10 million last year they're 19.3 million for the current year the non-current assets primarily you fixed assets which is this building that we're sitting in all of the assets the park the utility assets the police cars all of it that equates non-current assets and it's primarily fixed assets you do have some restricted cash for construction projects but primarily it's in the form of fixed assets 136 million last year it's 165 million this year you can see the non-current total assets of the city of youngsville last year 146 million this year it's 184 million remember we've issued some debt as we talked about 20 some odd million we still have pretty much all of that as of June to be spent on construction projects but it's so it's all included in that but we'll watch we'll look at our debt in a minute total current liabilities on the bottom half of the page with 10.1 million last year they're 13.3 million this year and then your non-current liabilities are all shown 46 million versus 72 million because we've issued more debt so total liabilities of the city increase from 56 million to 85 million so about a 29 million dollar increase in liabilities and what's our remaining net position as indicated here very bottom line total net position of this city was 89 million last year of which we had reinvested about 79 million in the form of capital assets and this year we have a hundred million with about 78 million being reinvested in net capital assets and we also have about 14.2 million dollars that's restricted for capital projects what I want to focus on guys is the unrestricted which is only 319 thousand if everybody sees that and I want to also add back the sales tax dedications of about four million dollars okay so everybody sees that it's about four and a half million dollars last year that same number if you look at those two numbers the 5.7 plus the 300 thousand was about six million so our available surplus going forward taken out the capital assets that we've already reinvested and the capital projects we're basically at about 4.5 million this year we were at 6 million last year so it's come down and just to give you an idea based on your operational spending looks like you would have somewhere around 86 days of available surplus citywide which is almost three months it's 2.9 months and as we've talked about in the past you should have at least 60 days okay so you're it you can say 90 days last year we were at 118 days we were at 4 months so we basically dropped about 30 days about one month of surplus and that's why we're cautioning that we need to get a handle on the expenses and be as efficient as possible because our revenues have flattened so I wanted to point
