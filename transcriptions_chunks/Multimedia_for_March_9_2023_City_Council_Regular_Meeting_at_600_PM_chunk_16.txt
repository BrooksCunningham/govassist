sir Yes, so we have two phases and part of why we phased uh highway 89 is based upon your capital outlay funding you are going to get more But we as soon as you get a gmp From a contractor you can't add more capital outlay money. So If you were to get the capital outlay money after the gmp if you did the whole thing and it exceeded what you had You wouldn't be able to use it So what we did is we phased it to what you have right now so that when your priority five money becomes priority one That goes into the phase two and it doesn't stop us from getting the contractor to start We we are so in the event that there's we did promise the business owners in the second phase correct new news Pam alluded to it but between fortune road and This intersection it is going to be a little bit more there's more movie pieces.
