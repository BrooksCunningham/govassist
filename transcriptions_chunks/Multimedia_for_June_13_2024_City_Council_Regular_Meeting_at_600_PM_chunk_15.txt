see a beautiful you know history enriched home in that lot but it's just not happening I haven't seen it in 10 years in two decades and I don't see it in the next five years I hope that I'm wrong and I hope that someone builds a beautiful home there but if it stays empty I just want to make sure that we as a council on the same page because these conversations are going to continue to happen. You know my fan in month out and so I just want to make I don't I don't think that we should motion to if we want to motion to table I'll entertain that motion I don't think making your rational decisions tonight for what the future could look like without having any kind of dialogue and discussion with the residents or the historical society I think that's a bit of radical but I think we want to table this and have some further you know deep discussion on it in the very near future I'm I'll entertain that. All right thank you sir Mr. Giger do you want to since I offered you earlier just coincidentally you were here thank you. Yeah they bring back a lot of good memories about conversations that you and I have had and so would like to come to y'all's meetings because there's a high level of intelligence here that you'll talk about things and try to work it out at a very high level and I've been here before and I'm going to talk about that. I've been here before and you know some people go to baseball game and football games I go to city council meetings it's kind of a sickness I have but I just want to come up and compliment all of you as a group and and the citizens as well because a lot of good comments have been made I think you bring up a very good point Simone but Linda you do as well and I think there's a solution I think the solution is something we've talked about and it's called an architectural code. There's certain materials and certain forms that should be accepted in that part of town and it's forms that have been here forever for as long as young'sville has has been a community we try to do that when we did the buildings across the street where the MTS building is now. It's it's it's done in other communities and as someone in the audience pointed out it's what gets done like in Chogo Mil Pond they have a set of regulations there certain materials you can use there there certain sizes that you can use there. Downtown deserves that same thing so that when developers come they know what the rules are and they can do an assessment okay we can do this and we can make money and we can improve this community because I agree with you
