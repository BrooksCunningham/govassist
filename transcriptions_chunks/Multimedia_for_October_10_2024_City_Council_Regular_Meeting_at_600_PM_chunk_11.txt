anything with the, we've celebrated some great ribbon cuttings this week and you can always count on. Jamie to be there. As I noticed this week, but as an ambassador for the Chamber of Commerce. So thank you. All right, Miss Boris. I wanted to say thank you also to the city for the wonderful ribbon cutting. The turnout was fantastic. The Youngsville Lines Club is also holding a car show fundraiser this Saturday. It's going to be in the Steyne's parking lot at the corner of ambassador and eight nine. So I hope everyone can come and see the cool looking cars. All right, thank you, ma'am. I did think something that's not really related that I want to talk about leadership. Youngsville is hosting a holiday artisan market at the end of November on November 30th. We've got vendor spots. It's $80 for a booth. So if anyone knows anyone who does arts crafts, things like that, we'd love for them to sign up to be part of the artisan market. And then for the community to come out, the funds that we raise from the artisan market or going back to the inclusive playground, leadership youngsville class five, we are trying to purchase park benches to put out there so that parents can have a place to sit while their kids are playing. So if y'all would just mark your calendars, it's going to be from eight to noon on November 30th. It's in conjunction with small, I'm sorry, from noon to four, in conjunction with small business Saturday. So which is a national thing the Saturday after black Friday. So please get out, shop small, shop local, and shop here in Youngsville. All right, thank you, Haley. Any other business? Any other comment? All right, is there a motion to adjourn then? All right, thank you, Ms. Champagne, Ms. Barra's seconds. All in favor? All right. All right, meeting adjourned. Thank you all so much for the privilege to serve. Have a great evening.
