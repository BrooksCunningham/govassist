a lot more water. I'm saying that to say this. The biggest increase in your expenditures, if you look at your water expenditures, the biggest expense is water purchases. Okay. That went from $1,379 to $1,578 up about $200,000. And total your expenditures for the water department are about $190. So you sold a lot more water and you had to purchase a lot more water. Bottom line when you're looking at it, you had a profit last year, $311,000, that profit decreased to $186,000 on a profit. So still profitable, just not as quite as profitable as we were last year, but still good. And taking a look at the totals on page 69. You can see revenue's increase, almost exactly $300,000, from $7,381 to $7.6 million from $22.23. And you have the expenditures all listed out in detail, but just hit the high spot, $6.8 million last year, up to about $7.2 million or about $370,000 increase year over year. Bottom line operating income and utility fund, $514,000 last year, down about $70,000 to $442. But we need to factor in the non-opperating revenues. In this case, you have the property taxes, which actually the revenues went up from $490,000 to $536. And in total for that category of non-operating revenues or expenditures, in this case, it's a net revenue. That increased from $411 to $453. So bottom bottom line within the utility fund, you had income of $925,000 last year compared to $895,000 this year. So virtually identical, with all the different movements that I talked about within the funds and the categories, almost the same kind of numbers. And really they're good. I mean, to generate almost $900,000 a profit is a good situation. Any questions on page 69 or $7? If there's not, you should have handouts and page 2 of the handout is the per-customer per month. We always go over this because it gives you a different look and would be just saw within the audit report. We have four years of history. And looking at water, you can see the top line is your number of customers. Those are steadily increasing every year. The next line is the income. You can see income is very consistent. There's not a tremendous amount of movement over the four years, basically ranging between about $46 and $48. Current year coming in, a shade under $47. Operating expenditures, especially for the past three years, have been very consistent in water, basically $43 to $45 between $21 and $23. But you see the operating income trend over the four years. About $1050 will call it in 2020. Then down to about $5 in change, last year, $4 in change, this year, $236. So we're trending downwind in water and it's mainly because of the increase in the expenditures. Then we add back depreciation. And then that bottom line says operating income or loss without depreciation, another way to look at this is originating cash or not. So
