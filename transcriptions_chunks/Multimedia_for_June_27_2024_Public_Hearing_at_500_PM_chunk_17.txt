project for the community the road's going to be wide in six feet raised to where that area the La Salle Cooley went no longer go underwater sidewalk and that one's going to be before considering the credits it was 75% paid for by the feds wow so it takes time as you said one of them was back in 15 when we first took office wow yeah okay any questions comments yeah very good one yes sir but where are we at on the uh the nine million dollar bond for the is it the 99 or is it the uh that was uh we call that the 2020 yeah sorry yeah yeah we're how how much are we we bond that out on that bond issue we did a nine million dollar bond issue those proceeds are intended to be our local match for young so highway fortune road and then in this in this budget what we refer to is shimmy mettery widening that's the that's the complete reconstruction of the guillot shimmy mettery roundabout we have a design to have a second circulating lane all the way around that's past the state capital outlay hv2 phase now we just needed to go to the bond commission so as soon as it passes the bond commission we'll be able to put that project out to bid and then the nine million dollar uh matched dollars will be what we apply for our 25 that is that is 75 25 okay correct so so that nine million dollar bond that's what we expect to use our 25% share young so highway fortune and well the the small amount of lirivier that the monopoly credits didn't cover um ideally what i would like to do with it at y'all's you know direction we did apply for federal raise grant or a i.s.e that's a Biden Buttigieg's initiative we just learned yesterday that unfortunately we weren't awarded that project in this round um but i do think that hopefully there's some interim solutions that we can do there like add in a turning lane at agave um you know a mettery center as an example perhaps at um somewhere on the field crest side uh as a short term initiative and then we're going to apply for the raise grant again next year but that project even though it's designed is a very complex there's a significant amount of utilities that need to be relocated some right away acquisition um that project as well widens east milton and it adds that second circulating lane um had we had we've been successful in receiving the grant we would have had to reallocate some of our resources to cover the match on that project okay so in the end it's probably good that we weren't awarded this round we're going to apply for it again next year look at some short term interim solutions and it is probably even though i want
