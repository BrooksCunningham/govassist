debt for some leases we hadn't budgeted anything there so you had budgeted other financing sources as 23.5 million that came in at 24.5 million about nine hundred thousand dollars difference there I'm going to skip down and you can see adbalorum taxes from the utility fund Brad talked about that earlier and it's in other revenues and expenses the very bottom line the city y'all had anticipated with the proceeds from the issuance of the debt that you ended up with an extra or a surplus so to speak an excess of 21.3 million it came in at right at 19 million at 18 million nine 55 2.3 million dollars more than less than what was anticipated as far as the excess any questions on these items here again the details are within the the audit report which is about 85 pages so we we always try and bring this down because we'd have to spend time going through about five or six different pages to even get this and then you'd have to add all of this together so we kind of put it together for you so we can present it here and hopefully everyone can get the gist of what happened during the past fiscal year any questions okay hearing none let's go ahead now and and look at the third page of the handout remember we talked I talked about earlier we're going to try and look at what was the operating surplus and in other words I'm taking out the capital outlay because that's kind of some one-time expenditures I'm also going to deduct out of this some of the bond proceeds and so on so let's look at this look at the last column we have six years of history here for the city so we started with at 18.9 million dollar surplus on on column in for 23 that's the sixth column that's listed 18.9 million that's after the proceeds of the debt but to that I'm going to add back all the capital we spent 16.8 million dollars on capital so those are one-time type expenditures we're going to add that back to that 18 million but from that we're going to take off the one-time grants and bond proceeds that you had and that number equates back to about 33 million so the operational surplus or deficiency but in your case it's always been a surplus the surplus for 23 when it's all said done from an operational standpoint you ended up with $2,528,000 of surplus operational surplus for the city of Youngville and we have all the prior five years beginning with 18 and you can see it was 1.8 million and 18 2.6 million and 19 from an operational standpoint in 20 it was three and a half million 21 to jump to 4.9 million remember that big increase I talked about in sales tax we were showing tremendous increases of 16 17% increases in 21 and also
