critical path One critical path really minimized the inconvenience when the Tracked around about reconstructed for a lot of to make that project wider So to be able to route traffic from sugar ridge north to sugar to shimon Metery as opposed to going out on geod So I'm assuming with the name you'll acquired all the rights and everything to the property For Valesco plus we are we're waiting on a final plot There's two landowners that we've agreed verbally to acquire the property with We're waiting for an updated plot and waits ready with We'll be To go with then Yeah Yes, I have verbal agreements on it. So So ideally we'll be able to This project we may be able to somehow, I don't know we don't know how we'll prioritize it yet I think it'll be dependent on the time you know In part the Tracked around about reconstruction those plans by the way All right 60% complete our team reviewed them this week with the representatives of Nilshafer So 60% plans looks like they'll hopefully will be minimal right away there Not as much utility realignment there, but that for the public that's the intersection of shimon Metery In geod row near gofresh That roundabout is still constructed in asphalt. We've not reconstructed that part of shimon Metery We stopped at the limits of this intersection So this will be expanding that to have two circulating lanes North and south if my memory serves me right to move the traffic from South geod through the inner in interchange So that project it's a 60% design The other one the other big item is The veterans roundabout in the east Milton project Those plans are at 90% complete Um, and there's a lot of utilities that are being coordinated there because that interchange Has has it's a confluence of like interj slumco every everything goes through that interchange So we're working on how to Most efficiently get those out the way that will be the critical path of that project So i mean we could have the plans done already, but there's no sense of finish in the plans until we know that the utilities We have a better understanding about where they're going to have to be placed So from a logistics standpoint, i mean we're really Yeah, i think it all fall into place right i mean because everything's not ready to construct today anyway Yeah, you need you would need this I mean it would be a credit the the crossing would be a critical path in my opinion in order to make the roundabout as smooth as possible Especially with morning school traffic businesses and everything else yes Yes, man signage on uh 92 By the school that's covered up. Yeah, good great question because out for for days I was scratching my head about i didn't want to ask anybody, but i believe that that's the uh This we have a
