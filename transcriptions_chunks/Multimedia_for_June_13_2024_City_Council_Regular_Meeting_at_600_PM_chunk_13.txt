takes care of their concerns keeps everyone in line nobody builds outside of the boundaries and so on in downtown all town we've been here forever we were here before we had met your code you know you wanted to put a new light in the back of the yard you just got out there with the shovel and put it nobody cared today things are different we have codes we have ordinances we have a council who should represent us but because in the old town we have no set of governing rules this seems to be a going thing where you know today today things are this way tomorrow there's something entirely different based on someone who is up here who may not be up here next year or the next year so the things change they're constantly there it's a moving target and as citizens of all town we want we want rules we want governments we we want set rules that we know what to expect and what is not and what is going to happen in our area now we have lifetime commitments and investments in this community that by a decision of this board can change how much your property is valued at or not value that I mean if you if you guys decide it's okay tomorrow for somebody to come in and put a new style on that lot this little lady whose house is across the street is going to be devalued like there's no tomorrow and there's nothing she can do about nothing so in all town when you suggested when you suggested some type of organization that says this is what old town would like can as old town we decide what we will have in our area and not just like they do in the subdivisions I think that's a good idea and I think there's a whole lot of people who live in old town who would agree with that and there's a whole bunch of us here tonight who will step up tonight and tell you we are ready to form that organization tonight to help govern ourselves in this area and I hope you guys would take a step on it and ask for what's on the table tonight please table that and let's talk about it.

I live on Second Street and I definitely thank Simon Shampine and I thank you Shannon because the traffic first of all for me on Second Street about a year ago I have fought and wrestled with and I have no children and no grandchildren here so I fought with the traffic going to school. I could come in but then when I if I was back at the end of the street I was told yes you can go pass it do you realize how I'll rate you will get people
