be filled I'm in that position right now the CID supervisor yeah I'm taking on responsibility that the CID supervisor was there went to patrol because we needed it's supervising the cover to shift so because that shift already was short I had only two officers so the way the motion read if correct me if I'm wrong was to allow to fill three vacant positions and add one SRO for charter school USA that's great so to give you the ability to fill three vacant positions and then higher one additional officer for that SRO position yeah that's what we got because the CID sergeant position he went to cover patrol because of the other subject pending yeah I mean I'm not yeah I think that I think the position wise I'm not worried about yeah just to reset for me and I think the only question that we had was whether or not it was whether it was what the impact of the litigation correct the right right I'm not to say we will never show these positions yes no no we're trying to get on the same page yeah I think we're on the same page because the thing is we positions the last right and SRO okay we have been we had applicants in the process we processed our written I spoke with Kristen we had three vacancies to fill yeah so of those five we chose the best three candidates that we thought would fit for the young's police department they were contacted last Friday so they can continue the hiring process they all turn this down okay so now we back at square one we do have other people right now in the the process that's being published you know processed but that's where we had so so you're looking for three yes yeah and we have the ability to have three yes yeah the ability the only variable is just whether or not where where the person under appeal is that that's the only question that's the only clarifying question that I think there is so yeah okay any reason why they turned us down well one decided to stay where he's currently employed and if I'm not mistaken I know for certain one went to the left and pair of sheriff's office I think maybe both but for certain one I forgot what the other reason was well and saying great all right any any other comments or questions are any other any other business before the council to see me ready start motion to adjourn motion adjourn all right thank you mr. eros second by mr. standsbury before I just want to compliment and thank mr. barley Mrs. Greg and Terry and all of our department heads for working together and of course for the cooperative cooperative spirit of the council members for getting the budget approved tonight so thank you all very much all in favor of a journey all
