before public hearing, we hear our team's comments on the proposed development and it goes through a, you know, development process for planning. You'll also probably recall to know if the developer chooses to just leave everything, you know, on a blank parcel, how it's platted, it goes through our planning department, really just looking at land use of how it, how it runs today. So recognizing that at the time that was one of the other reasons that you asked for low density developments to come before you in the event that there's a future developer that wants to maybe not subdivide. We had it, we had at least two developments that I'm thinking of in the past, you know, the year or two that the developer chose not to subdivide and it went straight to permitting and the permitting was based on the land use. So you enacted this, what you would like to see some components of low density developments and enacted just a trigger to where the developer can come kind of pitch the idea to you before the developer gets too far into the process. So basically that's what we're here today for is to, is to, you know, hear the concept Mr. Gula has provided some photographs of, you know, what the property, you know, could look like under his design plan. And at that time, I guess I'd like to, you know, ask Mr. Gula to come up and his engineers also hear Mr. Chad Russell. There's any questions. But I guess before he starts, is there any comments or questions from the council is to like what we're doing, so to speak? All right, Mr. Matt. Thank you guys for the opportunity. So I've been looking for the right location to do something like this, this type of concept for a while now. It really takes the right size lot, right location that's, you know, walkable to amenities and has a deep lot. And what a cottage court is essentially is a, it's considered like a pocket neighborhood. So think of a big neighborhood and a smaller pocket of that surrounding a common area. So this is essentially a common green space in the middle where cottages front face the common area with like patios and such. And it's, it's kind of like a thriving little community. And there's proof concept in other major cities. I know we took a lot of the design standards from a city called Cornel, Indiana. I know that's a, a thriving city and they use this concept there and it worked well there. So that's basically what it is. At the end of day, it's about revitalizing this location. There's currently a trailer on it. I think this would be a perfect opportunity to kind of create a buffer from where it's at to the park. I know the park was renovated recently. And I think this is just going to be a huge upgrade right
