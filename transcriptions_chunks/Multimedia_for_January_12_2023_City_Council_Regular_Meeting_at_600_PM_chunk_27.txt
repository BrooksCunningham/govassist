it and said Give a surprise to go all the way to construction. So we did we submitted that to them on Last Friday and they said they were it's in review to the state if the state approves They will send the city a cooperative endeavor agreement So that we can start they want to do one cooperative endeavor agreement with all costs identified and funding They will have to get additional funding originally. I think they were given you 3.6 million They did ask that you do what they call nature-based solutions. So we had designed it as a dry pond They wanted as a wet. We said sure absolutely. It's just money You know if you're willing to give it will dig some more will add the plantings and everything So the cost to do what they want to do is actually a six million dollar project So if they want to if they find the funds It's our understanding of the first round. There's only one project that's Been bid to date from the 2016 flood and that bid last month and we have a second project getting ready to go to that so They're looking for projects.
