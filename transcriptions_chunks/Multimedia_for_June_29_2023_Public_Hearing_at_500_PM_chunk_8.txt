public works department, 2 million 64 thousand actual number last year, 2 million 2 and 94 thousand for the current year and for the budget year, 2 million 2 million 4 63. Utility expenses, Brad just mentioned those, 6 million 867, actual last year 7,600 for the current year and 8.4 million for the budget year. Sports complex, he just mentioned those 4.5 million last year, 5.3 million for the current year and 5.6 million for the budget year. Now capital outlay and Catherine tried to break it out into the different segments, but all of this will match with the tolls on the pages I think 5 and 6. Under governmental, it was 9 million 955 last year. That included this sports, this municipal complex. Then this year estimated at 11 million dollars and for the budget year as we talked about 42.4 million dollars. Under fire protection was 131,000 estimated for this year, for capital and next year 257,000. Police, the capital outlay for police this year is 169,000 last year was 608,000. And let me just say the actual numbers were not broken out last year was just in total. So that 9 million that shows under governmental, some of that is police, some of it may be fire protection. I just want to point that out. It wasn't broken out on the audit in detail that we tried or the administration tried to break it out this year. Under municipal complex, 7.1 million last year this year finalizing this, 3.5 million. So as you can see, about 10.5 million for the complex over the past two years, nothing forecasted for next year. Utility fund, capital, 15 point, basically 15 million 35,000 for the budget year and the sports complex, 15 million 932,000. So if you add up the 42 million and the 15 and the 15, you're talking about the 74 million that we spoke about. On the debt service, you can see the principle and interest. Last year we had some refinancing that took place in this and that's why the 9 million is shown as principle this year. It's 4.1 million is more of a normal year and next year is going to be 4 million dollars as well. The interest was a million one last year. It's going to go up to a million five this year and 2.3 million dollars with the additional debt that's been issued for next year. So you total debt service forecasted for next year. You add the 4 million 99,000 and the 2 million 371,000. You're talking about 6.4 million dollars of debt service for the city. Total expenditures, you can see 48 million actual last year this year, 44.9 million and for the budget year, 108 million dollars of expenditures. So the operating losses at this line item, 17 million 559 last year, 2.7 million dollars estimated for the current year and a huge number at 36 million 756 for the budget year. You have some
