Let us do it and you can I review it. Correct. So to me, that's, if that's the only thing you have next year, that'd be fantastic. Any other questions or comments? With that being said, let's get to the operations of the utility fund. And that is on page 69 and 70 in the audit report. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to start on page 70 and go through each individual department. And then we'll talk about the utility fund as a whole. I'm going to hit the high spots. If anybody has a question, does he something they want to ask me about? Just go ahead and stop me. You will address that at that time. So looking at page 70 on the far right, you see sanitation for both 2022 and 2023. And total revenues did increase by quite a bit. A million 481 last year to a million 648 this year, you're talking about about $165,000. You go down to the second to last line item and you can see expenditures last year, a million 618 versus a million 852. So we had revenues increase 165,000, but expenditures about 235. So you can see that bottom line operating loss. Last year we had a loss of 137,000 this year and increase of that loss to 204,000. Ideally in sanitation, you'd like to be making a little bit of money or break even. I think you're looking at the agenda. You actually have something on the agenda tonight to address so that hopefully I'm standing here next year. We're in that slightly profitable to break even situation. So this is going to be addressed tonight, where we're not in a negative anymore. Moving on to sewer, you can see revenues increase from $2,259 last year to $2,325. So about $65,000. Not a bad increase, not huge, but not bad. Moving on down to the expenditures, you have a more listed out there. There's some variations between categories, but in total you spent a million 919 last year compared to a million 865. So you're talking about $55,000 in savings or less expenditures this year. So increasing the revenues, decreasing the expenditures, bottom line improves by approximately $120,000, the $340,000 of income last year to $460,000 of income in the current year. So sewer is a real bright spot this year for the utility fund. That's the best one we're going to take a look at. Moving on to water, almost the identical same dollar value increase in the revenues from $3,640,000 to $3,707. So approximately the same $65,000. The difference is in water, if you look at the two revenue sources, the first line, $3,40,000 versus almost $3.3 million. So you sold a lot more water. The next line is Miss Alaney has went from $600,000 down to $415. This is going to be reconnections, penalties, and things like that. So you had a lot less of those this year, but you sold
