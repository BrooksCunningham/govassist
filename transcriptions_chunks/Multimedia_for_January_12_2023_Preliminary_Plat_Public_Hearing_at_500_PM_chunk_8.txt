a connection with the park and there was some consideration during the previous preliminary flat review about where win and where the win the traffic impact analysis would take place because this is of a different because it's of a different density the developers agree to to have it done now at the normal time so but I invite Mr. David maybe tell us a little more about the common area since it's going to be such a focal point of the development. Thank you Ken let me start with the one variance request on the issue of the TND with starters thinking about the TND is as we went through the master plan we were adding things that we would typically only build within the TND we have commercial frontage on shim and metery we have a more refined layout that I'll show you in a minute but an important element of the TND. So we look at the question of whether we will do that as well as other things there are greater open space requirements I mean there are a lot more requirements on TNDs than on conventional neighborhoods but we thought that the site lend itself well to a TND and as I take you through some of the amenities in the town center layout hopefully you'll agree with that. So we have a lot more than just a few of the minimum of 50 acres your TND ordinance which we helped put together I think was enacted in 2002 maybe a lot has changed in the TND world since 2002 you know we're 20 21 years later So these examples all across the nation of TNDs and on as small as 10 acres of property over time what's happened in a lot of the urban areas is that they're trying to create the same quality of life that TNDs have in urban areas and instead of having single family detached homes they meet all the requirements of the TND but all of their residential or mid and high rise apartments and condos for sale but they have all of the mixed use built into them and they actually qualify as a TND in those instances I try to find anything that was done in the last 10 years that required a certain landmass and I could not I did pull up I was referred to an article in Wikipedia of all places but they kind of summarize with TND requirements are across the board. And if you Google traditional neighborhood development and Wikipedia you'll get the article but basically it list all the requirements of the TND which includes says to qualify as a TND a project should have a range of housing types which we do we have single family detached homes we have town homes we have apartments are rent we have condos up front for sale network of well connected streets and blocks which we have a lot of work to do
