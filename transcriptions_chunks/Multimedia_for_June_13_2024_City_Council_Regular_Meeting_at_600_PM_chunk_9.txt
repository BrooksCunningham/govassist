recall in the house I mean just to reiterate I guess what you said I mean it's needs extensive repairs it does it does we were about 160,000 and they wanted way too much for it got you yeah even to move it it would cost yeah a lot of money to move that house off of it so it's it's being bought by someone else we have no idea we got it okay it's already I didn't realize it was being subdivided but that's it's good to know I did know about the extra feed I was told about that earlier yeah I want to get miss councilman Barras in but you know just to kind of take a step back I think you're both are making excellent points you know and I think and I Mr. Gidry's here in the audience I'm going to get him involved in a few minutes because about 10 years ago when we passed our land use ordinance for the city of young so we we took at the time that in it's still today if you look at that ordinance it's referred to as Royville the Royville district of our land use ordinance and you know that that was a vision at that time actually Mr. Gidry he's an architect that really guided us through that process and he's helped us at other times where I felt we've had an impasse of this building being a great example of it actually I've got a consult with Mr. Gidry he's here tonight by coincidence because I wanted to we wanted to preserve the tree here so how do we do that how do we shift it and how do we you know how do we take what you what we want and how do we achieve that goal at the time Mr. Gidry talked to me about doing additional an additional layer of my call and regulations is because that's what comes top of mind for the area defined in the land use ordinance as Royville and that was basically school street you know first to fifth I mean you you guys know the area it's the original village at the time you know bringing in just land use telling you what you can do on your property was kind of I felt we were pushed in the envelope too much at that time so we took a pause and I told Mr. Gidry I said I don't think we're quite there yet but so to miss Shampon's point maybe there is opportunity now because I do think it's going to be important a lot of what we do as an as an administration is meet with potential landowners for development the reason at the time the council wanted an ordinance with more restrictions is because we saw some product coming into the community that we really felt you know if we asked you know 10 people we felt a majority would say
