a collegiate tournament with 10 different softball teams from seven different states that coincides with the largest independent parade to my knowledge in the area. I'm sure it's larger than the area. We were overall very pleased. So without further ado, I want to acknowledge, announce the winners. And then those that are here, after we announce them all, we'll invite you to come up and take a picture with the council for the best original float for the 2023 Youngsoe Mortigal parade with crew decant. All right, I hear them here. All right. Congratulations, crew decant. Prudest float is crew dec... Crew decray. OK, all right, yeah. And most spirited float, crew delay or lie. All right. Perfect. I feel like I've seen y'all's name before. Was it just on the permit or have y'all wonderful? OK, that makes sense. That makes sense while you look familiar and everything. So all right, well, let's get... We have not figured out the best place to take pictures in here yet. Yeah. Why don't you all want to try to do it in the front, just now? Since it's only a smaller group, let's see what we can do. So let's invite crew to camp up first, and then we'll get crew decray, and then, of course, right after that, the most spirited float as well. So... Yeah, how about that? Let's invite our guests maybe... How about y'all want to come in front of us, and then we'll just stand at our spots and want to try like that? Yeah. Congratulations. No. I think that's why I'm so really happy. I love the spirit. How's it going? Hey, what's going on? Nice to see you. Thank y'all. Good ride. Good ride. So... And the pole's going to take a cold. All right. Are we good? Yeah. How's it look, photographers? It's great. All right. All right, congratulations, crew to camp. Best original float. All right, how about our prettiest float? I should have had this teed up to where I had your pictures on the screen. So... noted on my... After... On my to-do list or the after-action Marty Gras stuff, we're going to get that straight. I know so much. Hey, Chelsea, congratulations. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Angel, thank you so much. Congratulations. All right. Come on, I'm going to do it. Thank you. And we have more. We have ours. We have ours. Yeah. Perfect. Congratulations. All right. The last... The last but not least, our most spirited float. So is it spirited three years in a row? Or was it? No. Rehabilites, break and float. So you've gotten the trifect with it, right? It's pretty good. Every category? All right. Thank you. We appreciate y'all. We appreciate y'all staying. Thank you so much, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. All right, yeah. Just good now. I'm going to leave the page. This is going to be all right. Thank you. All right. Congratulations. Thank you all
