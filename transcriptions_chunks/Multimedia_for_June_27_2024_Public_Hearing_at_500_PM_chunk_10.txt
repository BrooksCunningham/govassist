or possibly OCG, but another governmental body. Intergovernmental last year was 9,379. This year, it's estimated to be about 6 1.5 million. Next year, we just pointed that out. We've got a lot of grant monies, $16,852,000 of monies coming in mainly from state monies, some from federal, and so on. Fines in court cost, 1,346 last year, it's a million, 77,000 for the current year, and it's a million, 66,000. Pretty much flat for next year. Utility charges for services, which is your water, your sewer, and your garbage. Brad went over those just a moment ago. Last year we brought in 7,590, this year it's 8,500,000, and next year 9,519,000. And again, I think he went over the number of customers, and mainly residential customers that have increased. And so there's some forecasting that that's going to take place again next year. Miscellaneous revenues, 378,000 last year. It jumped up to 813,000. And Katherine, I'm not sure about that, but I remember there's a 500 and some of $1,000. What was that? That was for our first contribution to the government. Yes, that was for a traffic impact analysis fee that we assessed to the charter schools USA. Okay. And then I think this is where you would also have like insurance rebate for. Yeah. And in fact, we were getting like a workers' comp rebate or anything like that. But the biggest thing was that one item, that 500 that I saw, and that was from the charter schools. Okay. And then next year, basically we're going down flat to 88,000. Again, I think that's conservative. I think it'll be better. I mean, you know, but until you get rebates and things like that, you know. Until you have it, Ken is better not the budget. So I like that approach. Next income on the investments 128,000 last year, it's estimated to be about 163,000 this year. And for the budget year, very close to where it was in 23 back to 129,000 sports complex. I think Brad went over this total revenues last year is a million two ninety six this year is a million two fifty seven. And next year estimated to be one million three fifty six. Is the park going to be fully operational next year? Are we going to be complete with all the additional expansion that we have up this phase of this way? We still have we still have the ability to expand if we want to do the two extra fields additional parking. But we planned to to phase it in. So that's where we are. But the phase that we we have now is basically finished this summer. Good. Okay. So total revenues for the city of Youngville last year, 40 million seventy five thousand dollars. This year, 39 million two oh five. We just talked about it as a few items that went up and some went down next year forecasted again with the increase in the
