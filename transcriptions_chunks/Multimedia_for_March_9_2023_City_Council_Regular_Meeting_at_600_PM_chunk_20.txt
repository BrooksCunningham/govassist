sidewalk project that we applied for in 2015 For safe routes of school from field crest to earn a scullet elementary It's before that it was under Wilson's administration It was it It was before it was designed before that So uh it's worth the man And Clint went to the pre-construction meeting for that project and of course it uh there is some conflict With the East Milton widening project because we're widening East Milton Uh basically it starts to taper probably around like a riley's ish like that area field crest So there is some conflict with this brand new sidewalk design from 10 years ago and our new design of the road widening um I was so excited that we were getting a sidewalk 10 years ago. I said don't stop it So anyway, I think that's what the signs are for Yeah Just wondering they will come Yeah, patience pays off It makes the detention pond seem quick Yeah So yeah, no, that's a great question.
