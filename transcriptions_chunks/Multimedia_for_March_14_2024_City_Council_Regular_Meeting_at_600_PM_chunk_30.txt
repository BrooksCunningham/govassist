9th at 6pm. The Youngsoat Sports Complex tickets are on sale on the chamber's website. It's going to be a great event with a host of Joe Grunig which was an exceptional last year. It was a great time so you'll come out and enjoy the night. And fire hydrant flow testing for the fire department is going to be going on the next two weekends. Just keep that in mind. All right. Any other council announcements Mr. Ramara? Yeah. The risk I know for the city cleanup beautification day is Saturday March 23rd. You know obviously we'll still meet at the Sugar Beach. Appreciate Tim and Terry and everybody else at Nell's to help out together and Angie. Hopefully you can get out. Still sign up on the website Facebook page and come out and just help pick up some of the minimal litter I think we have in Youngsoat. Keep it beautiful. Thank you sir. Miss Shampine. I just want to close and tell everyone happy Easter. All right. Thank you ma'am. Is there a motion to adjourn? All right. Motion by Mr. Romero. Second by Miss Shampine. All in favor say aye. No. Meeting adjourned thank you all so much and have a great evening.
