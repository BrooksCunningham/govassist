of give you some you know some comps I mean as this you know property in this area has been you know divided and subdivided several several times so based on your direction or your decision tonight I mean we would continue to work with you know these guys to you know bring something into to fit into the you know ordinances you see fit I mean if it's too I mean if I heard two of you say you know doing two you know homes I mean that one may not require there to be any type of you know variances at all I think really the struggle are the challenge the opportunity yeah that that this group has is to really to to councilman Romero's point I mean it's an area that everyone takes a lot of pride and of course the residents we've recently invested you know more per square foot in road improvements and street scaping with light poles and landscaping in this particular area the diocese has invested a lot of money we're here with intention to kind of be the gateway to this area foster park I think collectively as a community we're all taking a lot of pride in yeah so I really think what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that we like it you know what we just don't know exactly because we we're fairly in fairness haven't really had a conversation with the neighborhood you know yet to know I mean what would you like to see I mean we know some of the feedback we had on Avenue A and on fourth street and we were really probably simply looking at it from a betterment opportunity there but you know what what is the right you know what what is the right precedent you know with this I think that's good good that's that's the question Ms. Boris hi I do want to thank you for reinvesting downtown I actually walked to that school every day for five years when I was young so I'm very familiar with the area Young'sville historical Young'sville is my place and I am open to change I will tell you outright I'm not comfortable with three homes on that small lot I'm I'm willing to look at you I do think that we need to have a discussion with neighbors because I I am familiar with the area and I do know the people so I did make some calls today and they weren't aware of it and I don't think the three homes I just personally I to me it's a far has it they're so close so at this point I would not be okay with the three homes but I would be open to revisiting to as long as like I said we talk to the neighbors and see with their feelings on the subject or it is a small community everyone knows everyone else then they all have opinions
