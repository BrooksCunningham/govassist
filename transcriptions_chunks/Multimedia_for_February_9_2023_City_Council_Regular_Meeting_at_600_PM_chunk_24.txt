in the front. But if the calls continue, I mean, I'm just, I'm just wondering what our next action or plan of action is going to be. Well, I think one of the, I would be happy to be at chief. Every time we've gone out there, he has been in compliance. I even snapshot it when I did do it. When it was in the back, I did a reading and he is correct. The air conditioning unit was louder than any noise that came from the food truck. I have myself in case it can be a test too because I go inside when I go. I've gone out there many a night when I see a large crowd and take readings and every time he has been in compliance. There was one incident and it was for Halloween and I think it wound up not even being his incident. It was just got linked in together because I was out there so they mirrored the two calls together. He has worked with us. We've met with him several times. I've met with him numerous times and only because we've gotten the emails and stuff and then we started including him and in the email train so he could see what the complaints were so he could address him every time he has, he has tried, but he's correct. Even when he was parked in the front, we were still getting the calls and you have to understand it. As a business owner, when the cops always get in call to you, establishment, it gives it a bad look. My guys have tried to park on the side, park in the back so we don't scare alarm the customers. But anytime he has a crowd or there's any kind of live music or a DJ, we get the calls. Now we'll tell you there. They went out, it was about a week ago. Took a reading outside of the establishment, it was in compliance. They went into the house and it was louder inside the house. Now I can't explain that. I can't. That may have to be a sound engine. I stood right at his back door and took a reading and it was still in compliance. Is there any other public comment? I don't want to discourage the Councillor here from Mr. KC, yes, hi, man. I'm the neighbor. Yes, whenever his food currently, I have a picture of it right now, it is in the drive-through of another property. It's in the back of the building, goes to the drive-through of Yoka. Like Miss Champagne said that it's in the way of traffic. It's going to take someone getting ran over before something's actually done today. I did not complain, never was in the front, nor on the side. As far as the noise level goes, we have had just about probably every police come into our property in thought of our home. It's amazing
