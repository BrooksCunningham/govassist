construction there's homes under construction today but in your packet you'll notice there's a uh there's a yellow dash line that runs on the rights rights out of your of your screen of your um handout so basically what it does is it's cutting off approximately like ten lots on the bottom right i have encountered them but approximately ten homes in the bottom right those are within the incorporated or unincorporated area of st martin parish so that st martin's jurisdiction um my request you know was that the developer and from preliminary plot our request was out uh the developer work with the um st martin parish government uh to service or facilitate that area um my goal was to get it annexed into the city limits of yung zoo within st martin parish to where we would have you know ten homes roughly within our city limits that are part of st martin parish unfortunately those meetings have have proven to just not be productive uh with st martin parish i think they're um they just weren't uh ex weren't open to the concept um i do feel like we have an obligation to work with this developer here um he did make several modifications to his design um his lots initially on the on the initial layout were closer on shim and metery and uh while he's never reminding me of this i'm reminding myself i think initially the pond was going to be in that back corner um but at my request he flipped it to make it a better curva peel coming in on shim and metery and that's why you have the pond and the nice decorative fence and sidewalk along that road and then also the developer was extremely kind in uh working with this that corner that at the top left on the round about is a piece of property that was donated to the city at my request for the development by the development so uh where it stands today is um mayor president boulay and i have met and discussed this uh parish council member stansberry and uh what they're willing what lcg's willing to do or l us is willing to do is to basically amend our wholesale water agreement that would allow us to service these homes outside of our city limits um we do have one other arrangement where we do that and that's for geot village south uh which is right near the property that we just annexed there was no available water source there so we got a uh l us agreement to where we could service those lots what happens there is basically for shim and ugly are for uh geot village we have one meter and we so we have one meter we have one customer here um the way this would work uh dependent upon your your vote this evening would be that we would actually be servicing those ten lots
