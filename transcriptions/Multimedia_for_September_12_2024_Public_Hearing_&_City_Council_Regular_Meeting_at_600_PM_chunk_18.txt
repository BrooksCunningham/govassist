plan of 2024 uh that project was not funded adequately from the state on capital outlay so our goal there now is to get there's two complaints about that intersection one is the condition of it currently which i don't think anybody would disagree with that we agree with it back in 2015 or 16 when shimmy metery parkway was rebuilt it excluded that intersection so we knew that there would be a time that it would fail shimmy metery parkway from guillot to highway 90 was built in concrete that was a different time period a different typical section so we've reached the useful life of that intersection as is which is why we're we're going to be doing the full depth patching correct in the base condition that we've known has existed for the last couple of years uh so the first first opportunity there is to is the condition of it second opportunity is the traffic that's coming south south to north into the intersection primarily during school traffic as y'all know i mean it's no secret a lot of us do the same things bring our kids and go to work at the same time every morning so that intersection if you're coming from sugar ridge or south of sugar ridge it does back up so while we're waiting on uh that funding to take place uh to to build out what we've designed we're looking at interim solutions because there are interim things uh that could really solve the problem i mean one one i mean we're just going to say i mean what we're looking at is potentially if it fits right is to do a signal signalized leg of it potentially from shinnon mettery going east to where if you're approaching shinnon mettery basically pausing that traffic to allow uh guillot to flush through it more in the morning during the morning in the morning during peak times um to allow people there's not enough time the traffic's flowing too fast from west to east they're entering the roundabout at a very high speed and it does give those folks that are moving traveling north time to enter into the roundabout to keep them from backing up so we would pause them i'm sure you've seen those where you can enter into an interstate there's a light there it pauses use as if you know stop here allows traffic to go in and then when it's not and then lets you in after that so um we are currently looking at that yes really peak times peak times uh i think that's it that's all i wanted to mention was this the upcoming because i will be impacting traffic potentially if if the weather permits us to do it October 14th to 16th but we'll of course communicate that and try to do it with the most minimal inconvenience as possible so any any questions or clarifications about Pam's report all right uh
