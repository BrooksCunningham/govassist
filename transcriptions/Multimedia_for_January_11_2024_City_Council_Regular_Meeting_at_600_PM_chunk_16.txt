that out your general fund and last year your general fund was really down we just look at the general fund itself because that general fund is used if you can't find monies in a certain dedicated facility but you need to spend it the general fund is where you go to so we want to look at the strength of your general fund last year that general fund was down to about a half month that's not indicated on anything that I've given you this year we're up to about a month and 10 days okay so it is improving but remember what I said we're not at two months we should be at least 60 days so we're recommending that we look at this and and maybe Catherine and her staff could look at it and maybe transfer some additional monies if we have some available possibly from sales tax into the general fund to bring it back up to the 60 days okay so but it is improving that has improved you would need to transfer about $430,000 to be able to do that so okay I've talked a big mouthful of a lot of things here operational wise and how we stand surplus wise going forward so the higher that surplus is the better off you are going forward questions yeah that you have a question I do I do I was asking Mary by one to clarify we talked about assets and earlier in this conversation here and you were going through several of them you said police other things are we taking an account the fire department the multiple trucks the stations and I said because they're independent technically from some of the assets we looked at this at the time of the audit Catherine and you correct me please but I know some of them are not yeah a lot of them are not okay right they're on the fire department those assets and there is not say that is because of the city you know purchasing a lot of this paying for stations that we're just fine but I want to make sure if we're not including that that's good it's not including so we're not including it in our assets would tend to be a little bit heavier yeah that's correct absolutely more than positive yeah so it makes their overall numbers here potentially a little bit better right right we're giving you the worst case yeah exactly to clarify just to that point if I'm not mistaken it was the last three apparatus is that you put into the cities the latter of the rescue and the second engine we bought which have been the last the last the last three the only station to station one is the station two is the okay so the last three have been put on the city mayor yes the last the last three are in the city's name correct I can't attest
