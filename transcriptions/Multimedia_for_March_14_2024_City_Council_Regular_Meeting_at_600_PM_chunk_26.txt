away that you have. So, um, we've, thank goodness we've actually found some old plots that actually showed you had more ride away than some of the more recent plots and you never gave up the ride away. So, we're good. And we want to make sure to be able to show that to D O T D. So, that's been a huge deal, um, just making all the importance on why we're so hard on when people submit plots and what we want on plots because there were some plots that kind of, they didn't do the due diligence. And so, people said there was a different ride away than that there really was. So, we had to go back to the 1950s and 60s. So, anyway, so that's, we're, we're going to submit that to them next week. We'll have a plan at hand for that and we're hoping to go to bid. I believe in June on the Rivier road because we'd like a contractor before September 30th awarded for this fiscal year. Yeah, so that, that project since it is, since it is eminent, this is South of Rivierre from Shim and Metterie to the Flash in Red Light. Uh, and it's going to be a widening of the road. It's raising the road near us the, um, Flash in Red Light that, that road has historically gone under water in certain high intensity rain events. When I saw that. Now that, yeah. So, now that that, now that we have the La Salle Regional detention ponds and that water, I should have some place to go, that road will be raised, uh, to facilitate a more, uh, flow underneath the road, raised wide and in a sidewalk from investment. Uh, is it just to the school or just sidewalk all the way to Shim and Metterie? The sidewalk is all, is to investment. Yeah. It's, well, investment to the school, investment to the school. Um, and it will be carbon gutter. So we'll be, uh, you know, closed drainage and, yeah, so we will replace the bridge with some large box culverts and then there's also a single pipe, um, that is near hill ridge or I think it's, maybe it's double. And we're going to replace that with box culverts as well. So, um, really trying to help facilitate the drainage safety for the, those that walk down the street and then just a more safer road and passable on the higher storm events. This, that, that project is going to be a transformational really for everyone that attends south side for anyone that travels that road. Um, you know, for, for the, for the council's benefit and for the public's benefit, you know, when southside high school came, I mean, I think it's fair to say that south, south of the Riviera road was really in deplorable condition about 2,200 feet of it was in the unincorporated area, which is, you know, obviously
