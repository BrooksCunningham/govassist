project, there's a lot of brainstorming. So we're also looking at alternatives. And that could be rehabilitating Shimon Agriab or other options in that area just anticipating future growth and development as well. So don't lose sight and don't lose confidence in us. We have a lot of moving pieces and a lot of great things happening. So that's all I have to say. Appreciate all of your patience with this this evening. And you certainly have our commitment that we're going to, we will get through what we're going through and we're keeping our heads up. So I'll entertain a motion to adjourn. I think they want me to make my first motion as a motion to adjourn. All right. They're second. I'll second. All right. All in favor. Meeting adjourned. Have a great evening. Super.
