Thank you, Councilor. Ms. Sveta, Ms. Monica Abshires here this evening to request a setback variance for a mobile home located at 112 Young Street. Yes, Ms. Abshires, come on up. Good to see you. Same here. Good evening, Councilor Mayor. I'm here asking for a variance on 112 Young Street. I have a home up down there, Paseo. And for, since 2004, we've had a trailer on the side that was my daughters and then my other daughters and my cousins and my cousin passed away last year. A trailer was moved last year after 23 years that once been there. And I just lost a major cash sale because they were told first by somebody at City Hall that yes, you can have a trailer there. So we saw another preliminary papers and did a constancy sale and then a week later, her real estate agent decided to call City Hall herself and they said no, cannot be done. So I'm here asking you all if we could please do some type of variance being a had a trailer there for 23 years. Everything set up for it. The polls are still there. Electricity is there. Water's there. And I mean, I've lost one sale. I just don't know. My mom has a trailer park right on the side of it and yes, it doesn't sit in the trailer park, but there's a trailer right across the street from it. So I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's right behind more actually behind VFW and more of a launch in the dog place. There's a home there and then the trailer was on the side. So I think we gave up the have a layout in their package. Okay. So I'm just here asking if something could be done about it. If possible, if not, I completely understand. Any questions are from the council. Councilor. Mr. Bull, John. And you're so you're trying to sell the home itself and then the lot that is currently vacant. It's a home with the whole property. Yes. And so the was and then what's the conflict with the variance there? Yeah. So the the conflict our land use code requires there to be that a mobile home has to be 10 years or less, which isn't applicable here.
