Father Rusa couldn't make it, but we're happy you're here. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Councillor. I'm Dickon. Ed Bouchanty with St. Ann's Catholic Church. I'm here on behalf of Father Rusa who had a prior engagement with our first communion students tonight. So, but I'm here on behalf of the parish. We are requesting a temporary variance, sign variants. As you all know, I'm sure we have a major construction project planned for our parish. Well, I think we're going to be using this machine. We're going to be using this machine to make the first commission. And then we'll be using this machine. I'm going to be using it. And then I'll be using this machine. I'm going to be using this machine. I'm going to be using this machine. I'm going to be using this machine. And then we'll be using this machine. I'm going to actually be breaking ground very soon. And we have for many months now, had a major capital campaign underway to raise funds for that project. And as we are in the final stages of getting very close to our goal, our total goal for the campaign, really the final step in that process is hopefully to be able to put up a large somewhat of an advertising board sign where local businesses can purchase a spot and display their business names and company logos. If you've ever been at golf tournaments or things like that, oftentimes these sorts of signs are utilized. What we're asking the variance for is actually going to be two signs. And I believe you might have some information there and I brought some additional information I can share with you if you'd like. But we actually have two signs planned. It will be constructed on the corner of First Street and Church on that T intersection. They'll kind of be angled so they do not obstruct any view of traffic flow. But each
