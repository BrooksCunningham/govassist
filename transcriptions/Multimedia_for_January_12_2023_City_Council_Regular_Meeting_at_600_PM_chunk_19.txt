some it's consistent with really where we are with our land use ordinance Land use ordinance premises that we don't have zoning But we we have buffer zones depending upon the conflict level that are maybe between our residents in a business Today, there's no regulation for food trucks whatsoever with this does It's it asks that food trucks are located 150 feet from the Property line of any residential area, and then there's also Somebody credit me from wrong. I think the second component is a hundred feet From the front door of any similar or any foods establishment Yeah, yeah, go very Yeah, so Because I believe that if we were to have a problem with food trucks the reason I said monitoring them is The ones that we have have been working fine I've always anticipated that if we had an issue with the food truck It may be because one's locating next to a brick and brick and mortar restaurant that let's say has has complied with The regulations for commercial development and then if you have a competitor it goes set up in the lot next door Perhaps offering and it's free commerce, but I mean obviously it's an easier path to enter that market if you have a mobile food operation so Those are really the two things a hundred feet from From a another food service establishment 150 feet from any residential property boundary Encourage you guys to to look at this read the details Um, there is a permit that's being requested as part of this um, I'm kind of indifferent about that.
