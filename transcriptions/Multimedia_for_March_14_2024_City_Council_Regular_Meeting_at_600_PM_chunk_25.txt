comment or discussion in any public comment? All right, Ms. Gidry, please call the vote. All right, thanks, council. That concludes the meeting, but we have some announcements. I think we can go through some of our projects, Pam, anything you'd like to share with the council, and then we'll move to Tim. Yeah. So, we've had two on the fortune. So, not only they do in the road bid for the fortune road extension, but they've started digging the detention pond so that they can start laying the drainage for the fortune road extension. So, that's part, that's also part of the early work. On your 2022 roadway improvements, we've completed the majority of our paving work. We're in the process of going back and doing some some driveways, doing some punchless items, some dress up. And we are working on your 2024 roadway improvement as the mayor said.

And, um, you know, you guys hit all the buttons with sidewalks and the connectivity to the school and to a mixed use complex of commercial and, um, and also recreation not far. So, um, at least that's what I told them. It's out of really good, but, um, so we'll find out in June and, uh, let's see, I think that's, oh, and, um, on the Rivier road, what we had left to do is we've been working on your, the ride
