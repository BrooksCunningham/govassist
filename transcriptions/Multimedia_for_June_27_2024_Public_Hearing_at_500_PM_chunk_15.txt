from the grants and any bond proceeds and so on of twenty four million that leaves you estimated for next year for the twenty five budget with a surplus operational wise of about three million eight ninety six everybody sees that any any questions on those that analogy because it could get scary when you look at these bottom line numbers and a huge deficits of ten million or eight million like we have for the budget year coming up when I put it at the bottom of the page the actual numbers actual average for the last six years which is the six years of the audit these audited numbers that's coming out to an average that you that the city of young'sville had an operational surplus of three million eight hundred and eighty six thousand dollars if I add the two estimates the estimated number for the year that's going to end on Sunday for just this year which will be your amended budget and I add the budget for next year using the same analogy it's going to give you an average for the last eight years six actual two projected let's call it or estimated of three million nine hundred and thirty thousand so we improve okay even though if you look at those numbers it's very scary when you see some huge deficit numbers to start with so I hope that helps because a lot of times people get confused and say man we have a huge deficit of eight million dollars is will be forecasted that's not what you forecasted that's including all the capital out there that we have any questions there's a lot of numbers here there's a lot of analogies and so on Burton how do you feel about I mean the three point eight million dollar operational surplus for our community of our size and how do you feel that that is like in relation to some of our counterparts I think it's very very average for some of the cities in your category and I'm talking about city of Bruce Horde and city of Scott I don't know if you had done that analogy you presented that last night I didn't do this for the budget but I would see Scott's look behind you that's right Bruce Horde is pretty close I did it last night as you know and I did present something like this last night so y'all and Bruce Horde is very close perfect on that and I would agree Brad I think Scott would be a little bit behind and definitely do so would be less because but they're revenue based but you ask for people are communities you're so I think the point I'm just trying to illustrate is that I mean to have 20 million dollars of capital projects on roads specifically in one year 15 or 14 in utilities and it still be presenting you an operational surplus last year four million
