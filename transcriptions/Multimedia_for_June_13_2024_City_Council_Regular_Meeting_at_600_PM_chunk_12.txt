I live next to the 700 church street location I'm a electrical contractor and been in construction for 42 years that particular site is really small for that so I don't know how that's going to work. I'm concerned with traffic concerned with my grandchildren walking to school with the homes being so close to the road we already have issues with that with older homes on another note I agree with Mr. Moan Ms. Barrett I believe that's a historic district I've lived there for 26 years I believe here all my life. And I'd like to see single family homes on those lots not multiple places I think it's a great idea somewhere else but not in our historic district I'm just thinking that is something I think you should consider and hopefully make the right decision I'm here with a few of my neighbors in support. Not doing it so I just want to say from a homeowners position we don't agree with it. Thank you Mr. Como we welcome any other comment or public feedback if you'd like. Okay. If you want my giving us your name just my name is Penny who I live at 105 Avenue B right next door yes we do have a traffic problem I can't back out of my corporate because when I do I get horned at people will stop they'll slam on their brakes so I've resorted to if I want to park in my garage I have to back out drive through my front yard and come out the side so my husband parks in the back of the house we made another driveway but I like to keep my car under the garage so please we don't need any more traffic you know while and I fully support affordable homes I do because I'm not rich okay but I would really appreciate if you could just know please don't thank you Miss Penny you're very close we're very close yes okay yeah we've had we're so close people miss the curve and they drive through my front yard on rainy days it's just I see it a little bit more than others you know it's just we don't have a wide enough streets and if they try to widen the street my yard is going to get smaller if I wanted a small yard I'd move into a subdivision where I'd only have to pass my lawnmower twice and I'd be finished with that I like having a yard yeah so but I appreciate everything thank you very much all right thank you Miss Penny nice to see you Miss Ray good evening Ray Alberado I have been a lifetime resident of Young'sville I appreciate Miss Jean-Pine and Miss Barrett for speaking up for the citizens of the downtown area I think what we find is that when people move in a Young'sville and they move into subdivisions they are governed by a subdivision organization that
