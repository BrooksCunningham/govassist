18.19. So, even if he does want to sell the property, which, hey, with anything's possible, that would still require us constructing a road to the front. So, that's nothing that we would have in the budget today. But it is probably, it is very possibly a long-term goal there. And my assumption was it was an access road because you wouldn't want the traffic through your neighborhood. Yeah, I got kids, I got pets, I don't want to invite driving down the street, going fast. I mean, we already have issues with people speeding down with construction in the back of the neighborhood. You're very pissed if something happened to a kid or something like that. That's my biggest worry is my daughter and my son. Let me make one other comment that I didn't make. I pointed out the stub out street on Buy-U Lake Road. There's a second stub out street for anyone from Fortune Hills that maybe watching us from home. While we did make the connection on the second stub out street, that, I don't see any scenario where we would allow any vehicular traffic through that entrance. My thought there would be to have that permanently restricted with a gate. And I see that we could do two options there. One either have it restricted with a permanent gate that, you know, perhaps park police or parks and right could open if needed, similar to what we have at Third Street in Foster Park. But also beyond that, I mean, we could just have it gated off and have a small pedestrian gate to where the residents that are in the back of Fortune Hills would have a pedestrian access into this green space without having to come all the way around to the front. Yeah, I just really would like to rail directly from Fortune instead of through the neighborhood. You said you had two kids just curious boy girl. Boy and girl. How old? Three and five months. Okay, I have boy girl nine and five. I live in a neighborhood where there's one entrance and one entrance out. I get it. I don't want people driving down my street fast either. But ultimately, I think what the mayor said here is a prime example that, you know, I went out there for the first time today. I didn't realize how quiet it was. I like that. It's quiet. I don't, I don't envision approving anything that would change that. And also at the same time, I'm going to ask you what I asked myself leaving. There's how many people do you see walking around the young sports complex when you drive by. You see where I'm going with this. Okay. I just want, you know, like I get it. And honestly, we're here to protect you. You're a citizen here. But I don't think we need to worry about a problem until it becomes a problem. And right now, I don't,
