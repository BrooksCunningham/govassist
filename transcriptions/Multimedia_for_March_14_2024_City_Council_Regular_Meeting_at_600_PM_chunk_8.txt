uh normally wouldn't uh go here to this but most of these homes in this neighborhood were built far before that ordinance had been developed and expanded um I personally don't have I don't have an issue with two footies messed up back um I don't know if anyone else had a chance to go I didn't have a chance to personally go see it but I didn't see the photos and uh and have the drawing sent to me I did have one question um I did go out pass in front and and you can see on both sides nothing behind you and I was told it was a floodway behind so it's really not an issue for me I guess my question is if we ever do have to go there would we be able to if if and I know his neighbor has concrete I think pretty much their fence um would we have permission or be able to as a city if we needed to break up that concrete and do whatever we needed to do so mr. Wayne you welcome to come up just you can use the microphone um so the what's that question here is we have no easement in this along that back property line oh we don't no so what this is we this is a this is simply and conflict what not simply but it's in conflict with our with our setback requirement I mean setbacks are for for various reasons I mean what we look at particularly when it comes to this is really when neighborhoods are prepared for uh drainage mitigation it's really just how much impervious surface is in the is on the lot um you know one home is not going to throw it off typically but what what what one home could do you know in the aggregate the entire development if everybody had nothing but concrete of course it's an issue what one home could do if it's not placed properly and if there's not drainage mitigation you know like gutters or something I mean or some sort of drainage plan I mean you could adversely affect drainage on the neighboring properties I I don't see that as the issue here uh the the I think it's unfortunate you know what happened to you there was enough room in your yard it would have been it would have we would have worked with you to get it approved properly um the reason I asked you to come or our administration asked you to come was just to for the right way to do it was to have a uh uh uh a variance because you're requesting to encroach that rear setback so we don't have any need to be back that we don't have any usements so we have no business back there anywhere that's just when we review site plans permitting is really just looking to make sure in this case that
