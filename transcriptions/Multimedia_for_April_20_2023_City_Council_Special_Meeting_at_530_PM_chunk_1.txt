Thursday, April 20, 2023. I'd like to call the meeting to order. Let's see. Do you mind if I have the answer? I'm going to ask Council Member Romero to lead us in the prayer and the pledge of allegiance. My father, son of Holy Spirit, do you have any father? As the leaders of our growing city, we are gathered here tonight asking for your guidance and wisdom in making decisions. We thank you for giving us knowledge, understanding, and the ability to work in peace and unity. We are at the mercy and we pray to enjoy your blessings. Guide us in the following, your peaceful, and righteous ways. We ask this in the name of Jesus, amen. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, little liberty, and justice for all. All right, good evening everyone again. We have one item on the agenda this evening and that's appointment to Council Member Division A to fill the unexpired term of Kayla Menard Reo who resigned her position, effective April 3rd. I'd like to open for nominations at this time. I'd like to nominate Alessagna De Mor. Okay, where's a nomination for a Mistanbar or are there any other nominations? Mayor, I have a nomination. Mr. Logan Lano. Okay, any other nominations? Is there a motion to close nominations? Motion to close, all right? Is there a second? Second. All right, we'll do a voice vote for the Council by last name. Please, last name of the candidate that you wish to appoint. Ms. Gidry, please call the vote. Mr. Bajar. Dumbore. Mr. Romero. Luneu.
