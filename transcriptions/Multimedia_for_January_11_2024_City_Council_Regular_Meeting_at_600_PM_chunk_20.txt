youngsville Louisiana minne section 24-23 rates established for scribe in the rates charges deposits for water sewerage solid waste recycling service accounts service by the city of youngsville Louisiana council this is it's simply for introduction tonight because I want to give you the the right information our adequate information and so that way you can make an informed decision on it as you know we currently are charging $23 to the residents for waste management service that includes curbside pickup that also includes recycling it was last increase last March from 20 to 23 the ordinance that you have currently does allow the does allow modifications for CPI that's the consumer rate index you know the cost of goods there's there's measurements out there about that the audit report that you just saw shows I believe that rate was increased assuming it was increased after the March council meeting adopted at the March council meeting from 20 to 23 you really only only had the increase in April May and June so I think that's what our auditors were referring to that we did take an increase last year but it would only affected three of the of the 12 months of that financial report so what we did was we took the and just kind of given you my mythology behind it to where you can go and you know take the dependent upon your your your direction this evening if it gets rolled you know forward to a later meeting to be voted on again we took the average number of customers and looked at what would that $3 increase be should you look at another nine months of revenue since we had the revenue only for April May and June I think what you'll do when you go through that exercise you'll see basically what we see in that it's it brings you pretty much current to where you wouldn't be looking at a you know an operational loss within the sanitation department the issue comes in is that waste management sexercised two components of their contract one is a CPI increase which are which your existing ordinance allows us to move forward with should that be but this one is a little bit larger than most the any one that I've seen the CPI increase was 7.88% from waste management and then it's also coupled with a fuel surcharge of 7% and the existing ordinance does not have a provision to my knowledge to where we can make an adjustment on the adjusting on the fuel surcharge without bringing it back to you so in essence a waste management notified us you know and well the letter was dated August but it was effective June I believe to where it was that's a 14.88% increase in waste collections CPI and fuel surcharge so last year's rate increase brings you current but with the new CPI increase and the fuel surcharge you'll be having a similar
