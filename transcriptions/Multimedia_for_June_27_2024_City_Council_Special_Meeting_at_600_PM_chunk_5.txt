Catherine Acko with Mr. Colder shared. It's been a pleasure working with her throughout this process. She's put a significant amount of effort into it and just excited about the continued direction. That your leadership takes us in the finance department. I want to thank the colders, of course, and just quickly, I guess a message to our employees. This budget that was adopted tonight does contain a 3% increase for all of our staff. But I want you to know, I know 3% doesn't necessarily keep up with the cost of inflation, the cost of doing business and things like that. Your leadership, Terry and Catherine in particular, Kristen, have been working on pay scale, looking at comparable wages and other agencies and so forth. They've made a lot of great progress on that and hasn't they haven't finished it to present it to me. But, depending upon how revenues go this year, we budgeted flat. So, depending on how revenues go, I'm looking forward to receiving those recommendations from our staff. And hopefully, I think the goal is to put a merit-based increase in to where your directors would have some leeway. And it would cost the living and it would also be a merit component in there as well. So, I appreciate their effort in working together on that to bring us something. But I just want to say thank you to all of you for everything that you do every day. Because this type of budget would not be possible without y'all's leadership out in the field. So, I do appreciate that. And to the point about it being a conservative budget, I think we have a new... It's conservatively forecasted on revenue. I will agree with that. And I think it's responsibly forecasting expenses to still be able to generate a nearly $4 million operational surplus. I think it is something that we should all be proud about. So, thank you and more to come. So, any other business before the council? All right. Is there a motion to adjourn? Motion to adjourn. All in favor? All right. You have a great night meeting adjourned. Thank you so much.
