B, where the water well used to be. Last month, we declared it a surplus because the city has no use for that property. There was a water well on that property that was abandoned probably five years ago. We have no use for that property, so we declared it a surplus, and it's being returned back into the fair market for free enterprise to take over that lot. We no longer need it. So, there will be some body behind that lot that's gonna come here and ask, what can they do with that lot? And that's why we're here today to say, how can I strengthen that ordinance because it will be potentially a new development in your neighborhood? Mayor, can I? Yes, sir. I try to answer a couple of Jamie's questions. One, he asks about the infill. Why is there interest in infill in that area? And Jamie, from my perspective, look at in, I look at it as it's a cost thing that there's already utilities there. There's already a street there. And for a developer to go out on the edge of Young'sville by property, put in streets, put in sewers, put in water, electricity, everything, it's already there. And so if they're paying a little bit more then for vacant land on the edge of town, it's still a good deal. So I think that's one reason why you're seeing some interest in infill in addition to their improvements, this building and the other improvements that have been done. To counterbalance that though, is that as you saw in the slides, some of that area is really beautiful and some of it is not. So to answer your second question as far as what could the city do? I don't know exactly how, but if there was some type of incentive to encourage the developers to buy the land where mobile homes are, or the lapped data problems, or adjudicated problems, and that becomes legal. I don't know how that could work, but I think that's an area that I hope that we explore. It's Miss Longland, Miss Jackie, right? Yes, yes. Jackie or Jackie and Longland, I live on fourth street across from the police station and it's a nightmare if you don't live there and not know what goes on. Morning afternoon, Monday through Friday with the school traffic. I grew up on fourth street, it was so quiet. It was wonderful. It's turned into a nightmare. The subdivision that has opened up in between the park, I'm sorry, I don't know the name of the subdivision, but the Fairhaven, thank you. Traffic from Fairhaven, that blows my mind, that they can cross through the park with children playing there. Okay, first of all, with children playing there, if something happens, God forbid, I pray nothing happens, but what if? Please think of that, ladies and gentlemen, what if? Okay? The school traffic, the school traffic, Mr. Ritter had a sign
