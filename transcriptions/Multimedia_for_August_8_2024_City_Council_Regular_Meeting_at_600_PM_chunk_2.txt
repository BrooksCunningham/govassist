in nursing and my third degree was my master's and business administration of the health care with folks in health care management. I wanted to get involved in youngsville because of leadership youngsville. I was in the first class. It did a great introduction to the city. Got involved with the chamber, now involved with the Rotor Club of Youngsville. I think the greatest thing that you can do in a community is to be a public servant. And I think being elected to the city council would be able to provide me with that next level to really be able to serve my community. And that's really what I'm looking to do. My focus is on economic development, our local businesses, growing our local businesses, and then focusing on community. Without community, you don't have anything. And so I'd really like to focus on that. I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Just again, thank you all for having me. I'll see y'all around. I'll be knocking on doors. And I look forward to this whole process. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Council. Thank you, Citizens of Youngsville. Thank you, Mayor. Best of luck to you in a couple of November. Thank you.

Looking at the financial report, Sales Tax is over for last years at the time for NPP order. So we're on a bit trend there and then last, compared to for last month, we're about 2.7% of increase. We've also done some corrective measures on our AUP. I've read upon procedures for audit, so we want to highlight those here tonight. Various policies listed. Number one, we're continuing to fine tune some purchasing and payroll policies. We're reporting to the board today, which is one of our audit findings. And we have corrected our number seven is sexual harassment policy and complaint link that we have posted on the website. We're still currently working to implement procedures to correct numbers three through six. For various other. Okay, all right. Thank you. Great to hear about the sales tax.
