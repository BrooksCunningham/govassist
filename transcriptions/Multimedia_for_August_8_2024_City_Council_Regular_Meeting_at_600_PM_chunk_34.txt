groups of them, and a lot of areas, stop signs, this is solid poll. We just make sure we're doing the right thing for our children, make sure we're keeping these vehicle safety rules, texting and driving, all to a minimum. We have a lot of kids out every day, crossing roads, walking to school, like I said, as well as bus stops. So I just like everybody to keep that in mind. I mean, thank you, sir. Mr. Amerin. Yeah, I just wanted to thank Tim didn't talk about it, but all the World Series events we had and everything. I know we were at the breakfast for champions, which is probably your most prestigious event that we host, and the flattery that the mayor and our table was getting from China and Mexico team and stuff, how catered to them, and I mean, it seemed like everything went off without a hitch, so I commend y'all for continuing to do that and make it so great. It's phenomenal, it really is. And then the only thing I want to say is, to the three gentlemen that qualified for City Council and the three gentlemen that qualified for two places, good luck. I know you got a lot of work to do and hit the ground running hard, but good luck to y'all. All right, Terry, anything, any other council announcements, any comments from the public? I'll entertain a motion to adjourn. Motion by Mr. Bulls, Gianno. Second by Ms. Barras. All in favor? All right. Thank you so much meetings adjourn. Have a great evening, thank you.
