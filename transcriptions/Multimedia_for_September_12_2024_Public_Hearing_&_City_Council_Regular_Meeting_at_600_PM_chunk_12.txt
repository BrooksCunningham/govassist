allowed reading through the laws reading through the state laws I came in to visit with him and ironically he had the same paperwork I had and we're talking from the the same stuff and so I really appreciate that the council has its ear on the community and one of the things that I was talking with him about is you know there's a lot of golf carts that aren't low-speed vehicles right now and one of two things is either going to happen here pretty soon is either a lot of people are going to go and get rid of their golf carts and buy low-speed vehicles and then now they're going to be able to ride in the lane of traffic for areas that are 35 miles per hour under one of the things that I was speaking with the mayor about is is possibly creating crossing locations for golf carts crossing locations that are designated you know the crossover these 35 or less mile-prayer highways just like if you put a crossing like you have right there the sports complex with the flashing yellow lights and that way you have people that have access to businesses and restaurants and sugar mill pond for all of the events that go on we already have a parking issue in sugar mill pond for any of those events anyway we have parking issues that the sports complex and a lot of events are going on so you know it could it can be done safe it could be done right there's other communities that have done it grand out allows them to ride on the highway which I don't recommend that Welsh allows them to cross highway 90 downtown and Welsh which is a state highway so here it's a little different there's no state highway to cross and so it's a it's all municipality and city highways and so it's not nothing that needs to be done today I know this is the first step with the low-speed vehicles but I think moving in the right direction with the sense of community a lot of people do have regular golf carts that don't have the fixed windshield and the windshield wipers they have everything else but they don't have the fixed windshield and windshield wipers so just wanted to bring that up I think it's a kind of a twofold thing because I'm looking into it myself you know it's one of those things where I got to make a decision because we love being on the golf cart we love taking it to places but now I can't cross over highway 92 in front of my subdivision it's not just us we have 187 homes in there and we also have another 177 homes that are in Laurel Grove and those people are coming into our neighborhood too and are looking for that place to cross to be able to go to Rouse's smoothie king sugar mill
