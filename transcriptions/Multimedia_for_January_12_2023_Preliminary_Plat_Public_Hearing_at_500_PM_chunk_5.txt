we don't have frontage on some of the. I mean I'm wondering if that's like a because I would agree on normal alleys I just don't know if that's something that's specific because some of these are on parts. And actually came up in one of our West Village reviews where we have neighborhoods where the houses front on parts and that was an additional recommendation by the city. We came back instead of name in the alley because they were just concerned about people identifying where the houses were that didn't front on the public street. We came back with an alternative recommendation that we actually build signage that we put up on either side of the park at the street front that list the houses that front that park would order they are in and what their street address is for each of the city actually came back and said they'd rather us do that so I came the alley that for council consideration. Did you pay? Yeah because it's said for emergency response so I recognize that he's saying so I guess it becomes. I don't know how the area is but what's the best way of council and Volionna could say in order to see this one thing if I've come into somebody that is but it's a full reason for me since it doesn't have a little name and it's a alley. How do environment and the police department you may not have to sit and look at a small path like high end and come on to the street so I guess it's whatever it is so that they can respond to know how to get access. There's no house in front of it and the alley base is in the name. If you come into this development how would the park and know how to get to which point that's that's the reason why they're not with Warren and there's more for that. Sure. That's why it's in there it's been for me or that it's whatever it's for the park and that's what we dealt with with the city by the way so we gave the five apartment to choice. I mean actually the street address is on there but I'll just have to do whatever. So I'm guessing that those if left to if left to 911 right now I guess they would be named as addresses on street A or street C. In the rear of the place they'll just say that it's that there's an incident in a rear of or adjacent to house whatever I mean. I mean that place you look at the mercy of 911 because I mean what you know Pam could call in is not what they're going to translate to us it could be gibberish by that point so maybe if you're just freaking the ants I would say what if what if just that the homes are labeled on the front and
