sorry a culer sakit termination of that street. The other item which is a big deal for us is his number six under plat provisions a t turnaround is required at all dead in allies. The only three allies in question over clenches mouse now. Typically do not do that we have several instances in sugar mill pond where the alley terminates particularly where the alley is not very long. You know in this instance you got to think of the alley as a driveway that gets to those houses having a turnaround at the end of it just eliminates too lots. And there's no through traffic that's going through that alley to get somewhere else because there's only four houses on either side of it. I've offered in the past and I wasn't taken up on it but I've offered to put no outlet signs at the head of those allies just select you know anybody that doesn't live there understand and I there's no out there not going. But it's very important to us that that we get that way in this particular instance for the reasons that I've just identified. Any comments there. Just have a question about where where would trash be on those trash pick up and recycling pick up that they would be taken to the front at the road frontage there which is what we do in river ranch right now. In fact a lot of our allies longer than that and people walk to the end of the alley and deposit their trash at that point. Yeah. Is there an example in sugarmapon where you have a dead an alley like that. Yeah there's a couple of them right behind the commercial uses on trying to think of the you know behind where waffle houses and all that. We've got that neighborhood. You termed this one here in termination in a port right there. Yeah right. Yeah so you have that term right here. It's stubbed out to not stop out. It's this. Oh okay. And then it comes up like this and it does dead in right there. There's another time right there. I met you. Yeah. And there's a time. I was just counting. I was just as far as if anybody does come down there and let's say they were going to the last house. And they're at the wrong house and they need to turn around. They didn't have to either try to do a three point turn in that tight alleyway with the driveways or back back up the whole way. That's why I was asking for a two turn around there. Can you flood back to the flat map? Yeah. The color. Yeah. Zoom in on that as well. You know the changes of somebody turning down an alley that's properly labeled street addresses and all. And getting lost in that alley. I think we absolutely minimal if not not not exist. The alley they want
