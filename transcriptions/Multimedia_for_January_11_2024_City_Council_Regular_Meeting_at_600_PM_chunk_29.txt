forward on that but six alternatives all good all provide relatively the same benefit so it's gonna so the good thing is we have six different places that we can put the pond in um long in a road we're meeting with the different property owners in order to kind of finalize where we think the alignment's gonna be and we are scheduling a meeting with slimco for two weeks from now to talk to them about the easement kind of start talking about utilities so that we know if they're okay with our alignment on long in a road we've completed the survey for the prescott roundabout and we're at 50% uh plans with with that particular project on the prescott 92 and we are 90% complete with our survey a long 92 for your future sidewall drainage project um and that's it and then we're waiting we we are we have one more um approval from enterprise to get so that we can start on the drainage and the roadway work for valesco crest of crossing so we made it through the first tier of all those and we're getting the final sign off that they they believe everything for drainage and stuff they were actually fine with they even told us we wouldn't have to do the normal concrete bridging we have to do over the because it is very deep so we're just we're one step away from our letter of no objection to get started on valesco crossing all right yeah panel now had actually last many but how we heard the update back from uh the say legislature on how much the uh additional funds we're gonna need for young so highway when we could possibly hear back from that to the uh the additional funding so we can I know we've had a lot of lessons to ask how we're not doesn't seem like we're doing much work but I try to explain the best between the design phase and pipeline and then funding source so that's kind of the we're just kind of in limbo waiting to hear back so we did hear back so we know how much we can do for our 60% uh based on our 60% plans and the 60% GMP you have enough funding right now to do fortune to ambassador so the next um so right now they're all starting their sessions and we've told them that if there's any way that they can do an extra approval we would love to have it but if not it's gonna go through this regular legislative session to do it but that would be the next phase from fortune back to the 92 roundabout we did have a very productive meeting for some what I'm calling interim alternatives for that section to get to use some of your credits that you have from DOTD to get cash for that so that we definitely could do some sort of
