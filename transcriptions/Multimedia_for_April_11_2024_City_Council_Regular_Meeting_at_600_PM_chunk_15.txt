A. That's where it came in as maneuverability of those trucks, knowing what their loads, that type of deal versus somebody just hooking up with a Jeep or... But the first time pulling 40 people with a 40-foot float. So, that's where the 18-wheelers come in. As a... No doubt, search tree can turn up in search. It's not capable. And it is a large flow that I know it's a large peak. So, therefore, it looks like the millicholk in the parade now, search tree is the reason for the loss. It's a whole piece of it. Okay, thank you. Yes, Mr. Ramara. It's something that the mayor might not want to say, or when it comes to the downtown area, I also thought or probably called and whined about the most because I was hearing from residents. But then I turned around and he presented to me and said, call the business owners, talk to Father Russo or someone else at the church, talk to the police, ask them what they think. And some of the things that I remember being pointed out was, more violence the year before had to shut down their business and couldn't even open it up, because there were so many people there and they had to pay the ban to leave, to not even play. They lost revenue that year. In front of Young'sville Middle School, multiple years of fights. It was a hot spot for the police having to go there and couldn't get there. So, they essentially eliminated that one hot spot on the route. Really, Lindy brought up about the crowds. I don't know if it's youth or whatever, but people doing things in the cemetery that they shouldn't have been doing as far as urination and other things at the church. And then where the mayor said the lady fell off, she jumped off the float right before Young'sville Middle that year and got ran over. Again, that could have happened anywhere. But that turn that you're talking about, I've ridden in this parade probably eight times now. And every single time I feel like we're going to run over somebody at that turn by the car wash and the church. Because of the way it's a small street, it's not made. It's a not a degree turn. It's not made for that. I don't think it's permanent, not going downtown, but I think the way the route is the amount of the types of vehicles you have in floats, it's almost impossible for it to go down there. I know that he presented several routes to all of us, starting at the complex, coming this way. Young'sville highway all the way down, different things like that. I think one thing that's proven is that nothing's permanent with Martigrow and Young'sville. It's always ever changing and trying to grow and be smart about it. I think from a standpoint, when you look at the good and the bad
