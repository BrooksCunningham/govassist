factor in what's the operating revenues are the operating surplus for the year. Utility charges, Brad just went over this, you budgeted 8.3 million, came in at 7.7 million, 600,000 less than we thought and last year that number was 7.3 million. Sports complex, sponsorships and fees, you budgeted a million 457, came in at a million 3.13, you just went over that last year was a million 3.21. Fines and forfeits, budget at a million 2.45 came in at a million 3.42, 96,000 more than we thought last year that number was 709,000 dollars. A year before that was 8.51,000 so a significant increase in the Fines revenues. Estilaneous revenues were budgeted at 741,000, they actually came in at 404,000, 337,000 less than we thought. Total revenues for the city of Youngville this year you had budgeted 41.9 million, came in at 40,000, 100,000, a million 7 below budget, you might say wow that's quite a bit. Remember you have a 5% tolerance and if you look down at the bottom of the page it's 4.1% less than what we thought. So it's a negative variance but it's within the tolerance of 5%. The expenditures, how did we spend the money? Under administration you budgeted to spend 2.3.37, spent 2.490,000 dollars. That's 150,000 more than what was anticipated. Last year was 2.5.5. Under public safety, made up of the police department, budgeted 4.628, spent 4.479, 150,000, less than we thought. Last year that number was 3.9 million. Fire department and a lot of this is an appropriation to the fire department. Of course you do collect some property taxes for the funding of that but it's not sufficient. 2 million, 182 on the budget to be spent, you actually spent 2 million, 234, 52,000 dollars more than we thought. Last year was a million 5.70. You can see last year was a million 5.70 this year is 2.2 million. The mayor and I talked about this today. Part of this we think and the mayor is pretty certain it is is that you're helping outside of the city limits. It's costing the city this money. We're not getting enough from LCG or from other sources but primarily from LCG to fund for the out of city assistance that's being provided. So something needs to happen in that regard. I know you all have been talking about this. Hopefully we'll get some resolution on it. Yeah, and if I could just comment and I mean council you've heard we've discussed this issue before. You know, just I don't have the numbers in front of me but if I recall right we're talking about roughly a third of our calls. As the last report I looked at we're really responding to the unincorporated area. And you know we of course as you know we have a new parish council person. We have a new administration at the parish level. The free ride in the philanthropy is really that it's over. So
