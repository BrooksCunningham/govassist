the cost to recycle is considerably more than what it once was I think that's something that also we need to factor in um you know and that that cost recycling as I as I mentioned today is $7.27 in 23 cents per house is just what the raw cost is whether or not you use in the service or not you know years ago there was there was a much greater recycling market you know overseas where recycled goods could you know there was value in it um reality is the cost for these waste companies to manage recycling now I want to say manage recycling I don't mean the logistics of picking it up you know but the the market for selling those recyclable goods unfortunately decision what it once was a couple of years ago a couple of years ago that recycling number was was less than half it wasn't that long ago we had waste connections that provided that same service and I believe it was three some for that I have to look back but I believe it was about three dollars so the cost for recycling is going up considerably and in the CPI increase which is which waste management's contract does allow them to do is what the big variable is I guess the good news is we're hearing I'm thinking and it depends on you know I'm not I don't have a prediction I have asked waste management I mean what's their expectation for CPI increase you know moving forward I mean they've been non-committal to get to let me know what that is but they confirm that you can likely expect one and that would be you know June 1st because that's the contract anniversary so I'm just guess I guess what I'm offering to you tonight is presenting you some information you know so that way you know that that doesn't at your discretion whether or not that's a service that you want to subsidize from other you know funding sources because that's what's happening today there's not one now what is the what is that current cost per can for recycling that we're the we're talking to the customers the recycling the recycling cost is that we our residents are paying $23 flat and that includes garbage curbside garbage and curbside recycling it's not differentiated it's not disrespected there now what I've seen is as the as garbage as the cost of recycling has increased consider the market for recyclables has increased I think one of the things that we can do upon our next renewal is really value eight is that a service that you want to continue providing is that a cost you want to continue providing providing what's the outlook on recycling do you think that recycle goods are going to have more of a market or you know what's what is that what does that look like and what's the pulse of the community with
