know, placed closer to the fence line. I was kind of surprised to hear that because the property is much lower. Yes, in the neighboring property. We can go out there and see the properties. And what we can do if you'd like, I mean, we can identify the house and we you and I can go for a ride. Absolutely. And we'd like to have that information so we can add it to the punch list when we do the final walk through with the contractor. So all right. Are there any other questions or comments related to fortune hills or the proposed project at that space? Yes, sir. If you don't mind, just so you know, I can hear you, but your neighbors at home may not be able to. Since this is happening, will it, every zone are flooding area like we're neighbor will be resumed flooding. Isn't that probably him doing address them about flooding? Would it would this, let me try to answer it and then maybe, you know, part of, part of these projects is that we have to do, we have to do re-loamer. Yes. You want to watch you? Yeah. Let me, let me stay in my lane. More acronyms. Okay. So after the projects are all done. So after the detention ponds are done, we have, once we finished the project, we have six months in which we have to file a letter of map revision with FEMA. And so what that will do is we're bringing down the BFE. And so the new elevation that's going to be established with all of our ponds cumulative is going to be what we submit to them. That will mean that some of the base flood elevations in that area will be reduced. If that's, so I do know that that particular area at one time there, the, the fortune hill subdivision at one time when it was built. It would, the property was originally zone A and they did do a letter of map revision with fill in order to bring it into X. We did have a recent low mar with regards to Laurel Grove that FEMA did have that superseded and I think maybe some lots may have been affected by it. But if that's the case, if you have been affected by a zone A because of a recent, you can contact us because you can do what's called an e-loma to get out. So I think maybe some of those folks maybe concerned about that, but you can e-loma out because you are higher than what the base flood elevation went up a 10th with the new maps in 2018. And I think it might have gone up another 10th, but all of these homes were built a foot above the last BFE. So it's a matter of doing an elevation certificate and an e-loma out. However, you can do that, not what actually happened quicker than the
