what we'll see I mean dirt dirt's all being moved that's dirt not only for the roundabout in the row But it's also dirt. It's going to backfill in the the ditches for the entire project So we're stocking it on our on our property and drainage, you know the clothe the ditches, you know being Transition to curb and gutter So that when you get to like Lajara and Debell near heart to farm there's trees that need to come out there So that'll be that'll take place so the dirt moving Trees removed and then drainage progress That'll be probably you know sequence that we'll be able to see there Right and for a full clarification the dirt that's there please don't mistake that And I'm saying this for also for those people who are watching that is not the height of the road So don't want anybody to think that we're building the road to that height that is just to maximize How much because we have a lot of dirt that we need and you have a lot of dirt So best practices to be able to utilize that is that we do have to work it and as they're working it They're working it to keep it dry so that it is good to you know be used later So we did I did get a couple of phone calls of people thinking that it we were processed and the dirt That was going to be the elevation of the road, but no, you know no worries That's just our stock powder The ampieth yes the amphitheater I promise a promise Chris dax all of you They are going to be higher than anything that I'm going to be designing at that round Is that the dog park second yes South was there any of it on that at all?
