when it's on the side they we had discussion that they could use the drive-through window you know to the placement of it on the side enabled them to use the food truck you know pass something if it's parked if it's I guess if the food truck windows parked next to the drive-through window it's as I appreciated it was it was less than and out you know because whoever's working in the food truck can basically just hand it into the the establishment instead of having to get out you know walk. Okay I see what you're saying it's never been parked where the windows butt up to each other it's always been parked facing the opposite way so but again that still is a right-of-way that's a driveway it's also supposed to be utilized for a drive-through to the bore that's there now and I mean emergency vehicles if they ever need to come for that subdivision they'll have that block in the right there or if it's parked in the back it's blocking the rest of the hair salon anything else that they need if there's no way a far truck can pass back there. Okay we may have some other comments for you I want to get Miss Keele. Miss Keele, would you mind coming up just so I'm sure we got a we got a large view in our audience at home. I just have a question for you guys like where the he has his food truck why is there not an ordinance saying how long a food truck can stay there that would just solve the issue is how long can you stay there I mean everybody that comes in a food with the food truck it's not supposed to be a permanent place that's what it called a food truck it's mobile it moves so that solves the issue you know you can stay here put in an ordinance you can stay here a certain amount of time and let's move on and that solves the issue and that's all I gotta say. Thank you Miss Keele. Keecey did you have some comment or? Thank you Miss Keele by the way she is she is somewhere correct I mean we it is mobile we that's the business strategy too so obviously the way we wanted to do this is have it parked I mean by our business move it to these festivals and try to attract people to want to eat our food my whole business model it it is to own a someone like a legend's but nicer let's put it that way I want to be in between a poor and a legend's if you can vaguely see that my problem my biggest problem is I and look I'm trying to be proactive because that's how I am I've I've actually recently talked to Mr. Lewis hands alone because it's not my building I told Lewis that hey look
