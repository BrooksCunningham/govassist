you know we've had some discussion earlier this year related to development in this area of our city. We've heard some developments here at the council level and my goal by having this meeting tonight is really to try to strengthen the heart of our community but not over correct with any type of ordinances that may come from this type of conversation this evening. So I'll have more to say but I want to hear from you and so when we have public comment if you wouldn't mind come in forward give us your full name we have a timer you know up for three minutes but the council if dependent upon the discussion can we can see where it's gone and if we you know want to hear more we'll ask some questions because we do generally want to hear your feedback related to this topic to help us through this discussion we've asked Mr. Lynn Gidry who's up here seated to my right next to Nicole Lynn Gidry is an architect that has worked with the city since I've been around and probably before I think Lynn actually designed the city hall annex next door to us 305 I've various streets so he's a friend of our community and someone that I have great great respect for.
