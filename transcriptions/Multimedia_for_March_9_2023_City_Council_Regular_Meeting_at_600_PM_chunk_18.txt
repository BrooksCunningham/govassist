and everything else and there's other funding source So maybe if DOTD doesn't have it maybe DOTD can either if they don't have it through one of their federal highway programs or their normal Mount They too can request capital outlay in order to do it as well So it may be to put it on their radar that they that they asked for capital outlay And if then you have enough state representatives that know Then that's how you push it to become a priority one. So I think in their normal state funding That that's you know that fund is the fund that we've discussed with them before that they don't have a whole lot of so um But they need the help of state legislators to put that as a priority one in order to fund it and and I think that's very doable Yeah, I'll send I'll share that letter with them.

I have it on neoshapers report, but the Valesco crossing extension We're just exploring different possibilities of what's what's the best Path the what's the easiest most efficient route to get that road constructed And it may be part of the 2022 project once we get a rough OPC on it correct No yet, but that that stub out from sugar ridge to Shimon Metery, I think is a
