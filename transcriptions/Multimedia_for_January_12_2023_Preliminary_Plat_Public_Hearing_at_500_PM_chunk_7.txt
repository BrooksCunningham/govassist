five and replace with city young so as ordinances. I recommend waving condition 14 due to the council waving this requirement at the previous plat hearing this is for a requirement that's stub out into oak shadows a waiver is being requested by the developer for conditions 16 of the ADRC report this is the other same condition for the other street frontage and Blair at the same comment for the other hydrangees. A council variance is required for the site to be considered a traditional neighborhood development as this development is less than 50 acres is a ordinance 155-2 a perimeter fences required where a development fronts a public roadway a six foot perimeter sidewalk is required where a development fronts a public roadway.

Yeah it's eight on each side on the northern one and then there's eight just on the northern one on this side these have a street frontage looking south on the one change I mean just to I mean to so you recall Clint mentioned there was some feedback from old shadows that there was not there would not be a connection we were sticking with that but that's up to your you know you can change that if you decide if you desire to have
