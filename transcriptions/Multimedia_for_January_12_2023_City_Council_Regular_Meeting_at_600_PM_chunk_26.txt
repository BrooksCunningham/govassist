all of the drainage from fortune road to Ambassador Caffer on highway 89 Due to funding and the costs based on the amount of funding you have right now in Caprioli We know you're going after more But it's kind of a long story of what you have to do when you get to guaranteed maximum price for sea more when you're actually working with An agency and their funding. It's not as easy as when it's your cash So we have split the project in two so as of right now phase one is Around sable palms to Ambassador Caffer to work on getting that guarantee maximum price and the critical path is of course the drainage That's the most expensive thing. We've already nailed down The rest of the cost so on the roundabout and the extension. It's the same thing. It's All about the all about drainage so we're 60% done with the drainage that we need for the two projects So we can get that to the contractor and he can get us a price And then start ordering his pipe so that'll be his first order of business after the dirt So when you start seeing dirt moving around The goal is to be able to get the dirt there and to get the contractor to start being in a position to lay pipe We don't want them to mobilize and then have to stop so that's what With regards to La Riviera road where 65% done with those plans were finishing up the drainage study so that we can submit those Before the end of the month to the DOTD to start their review of preliminary plans so that we can move to final plans on the La Riviera road widening project We have on our 2021 roadway improvements. We have been working on 100 oaks drive as everybody knows our Pandora's box But all drainage has been fixed all cross drains have been done Curves poured Whether permitting we're going to start lay an asphalt Next week So hopefully within the next if we could get good cooperation It would take a week or two to finish up that project and get out and then we have just a couple of minor We know we have to come back and modify some of the patches on 92 And then we have The drive at center-sauce to fix and that project then that project would be closed out and we move on to the 2022 roadway project submitted as as you recall you were selected for anzalum kooley detention pond with the LWI They recognized that prices went up But nobody else had like prices. I mean nobody else has been doing regional detention ponds from a standpoint as recently in bidding him So we submitted a revised cost estimate and They originally asked us only to scope out what it would take to do the application and then came back after they reviewed
