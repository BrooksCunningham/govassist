But the superintendent is here with us tonight and he is a little pressed for time. So I would like to acknowledge him first unless there's any objections from the council. All right. Mr. Francis Tuchette, welcome, sir. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, City Councilman. First of all, thank you so much for always allowing us to come and share the things that are happening in Lafayette Parish. Let me start off by saying that today was a very important day for not only for you but for us in the Lafayette Parish School System. We had our chief of police that went well beyond provided food for every one of our public school employees at the four different public schools joined with the mayor. And I can tell you that to me that makes my heart proud that we can stand together as a public school system as a community and chief mayor. Thank you all so much. The teachers have been sending me texts. They've been sending me emails on just what that meant to them. So thank you so much on behalf of the Lafayette Parish School System. Just for giving you guys a short version of what's going on, I'm going to kind of share with you number one. There is something in front of you. This is called the report card. I actually had our communication team put this together so that if you guys ever have families that are asking about what those schools look like here in for me. In Lafayette Parish, you will basically have some talking points as far as different things are concerned. The next thing that you have is a report of what is happening as far as the schools here in Young'sville. You will see that we have addressed the last since the last time that we have come. I'm sure guys a lot of you have seen that we have been in the media around this district optimization. We have actually closed some schools. We have converted some different schools and believe it or not, we have saved just in that opportunity, $3.5 million. You will see that we also looked at some downsizing as far as central office is concerned. That also was something that the board passed. That also involved the $1.2 million savings. Last but not least, staffing for next year, we looked at consolidation and doing different things there and that additionally gave us $2.5 million. That to me is what we talk about as far as utilizing taxpayers' dollars to fund where we need to go with things. I will say that number one, my number one priority is that we will fund a first-year teacher starting next year at $50,000. That means every teacher on that pay scale, whether it be vertically or horizontally, is going to receive at least a $5,000 to $6,000 raise working for the Lafayette Parish School System next year. In addition to that, for the first time in the state of Louisiana, we are providing incentive pay. You move kids, you get more money. You don't move kids, you don't get any more money. We are going to be providing that next year. That is a big ticket item for our May 15th Board Meeting. You will see that there are letter grades here. We have three of the four schools that are A schools. You will also see that there are projects that we are happening. I am proud to say if you flip through the back of that packet, you will see that promises given or promises that are actually been made. That Southside High School is coming up. The field is there. We are going to put over 3,000 people on the home side. It is going to be the biggest stadium in Lafayette Parish. We are going to put 1,500 people on the visitor side. We will have at least 5,000 people in those stands. I can tell you, around that particular field, you will see a field house, bare none. There will be colleges that will not have a field house like the kids that Southside will have. There will be concession stands, restrooms. There will be various different things. I can tell you that if you just look through these different packets, you will see that things are coming. I will tell you, we will open up the first Friday night game right here at Southside. I will tell you, that means this much to me. I have been in this school system for the last seven years. Not as a superintendent, but for the last two years I have been to superintendent before I was the associate superintendent. The number of times that the kids, whether you are freshmen or a sophomore, whether you played on the varsity, they had to travel to a game. Whether it is your home game or not, we were packing kids up every week. You know how good it is going to feel to have our kids playing on their stadium, having the community that is going to pat that parking lot. There is going to be tailgating. There is going to be a real college atmosphere that we are going to create at Southside. I will tell you, that is my commitment not only for Southside, but whether you go here, you go to a KD and a where you go to care group. We are going to provide our kids with those opportunities. The last thing that you have in your packet is this district overview. I have my communication team and I have a few of these that I am going to leave for the public. My communication team put this together. You will see my priorities are actually given to you in the first page. I am not going to go into details about this, but it tells you how much money we bring in into the Lafayette Parish. $800 million is that ticket that we bring in as far as you will see what we spend as far as salaries. You will see what we actually collect as far as taxes. And you will see everything that we actually pay out as far as different charter schools are concerned. This is what I refer to as having an open book. This is what I refer to as saying public. These are your schools. This is what is happening in your schools and so take a look at it. Again, we have a long way to go. But I can tell you this right now, we are going to win and we are going to do everything we can to be the number one school district in the state of Louisiana. And it starts right here in Young'sville. We have great schools. We have great leaders in those schools. We are going to be after all May 16th. They are going to be flooding the markets for applications because when I can pay a starting teacher $50,000 to where that same teacher in Vermean Parish is making 42. That's a difference. And when I put something at the end of that salary saying that if you move kids, you're going to get an extra $6,000. That's going to make people move. So I hope to get the best educators in these schools. That's how we're going to move kids. That's how we're going to have the best schools. And again, this report card here is going to always be updated. This right now is where we are now. After October, I'm going to update this. This is what you can say to people who are living or moving to Young'sville. This is what we have to offer as far as the Latvia and Paris school system. Thank you all so much for this opportunity. Believe it or not, I've been on the road since 6.30 this morning. I have not stopped. I dropped by picked up my wife and I said, let's go. I'm running into a banquet that I have to get to. So look, I'll take any questions that you guys have. I want to really first of all, thank you the mayor. I want to thank each and every one of you for this partnership. I want you to know that our schools are open. Go to our schools. We have safety protocols, but go to the these schools. You need to see the great things that are happening in our schools. Great leaders, great teachers and biomees. We have the best kids. Any questions? Mr. Tuchet, I know we have at least one comment from the council, but we were also with our school board member today, Mr. Jeremy Hodago. He had something with his daughter this evening in regrets he wasn't able to attend. He did send me a statement that he asked that I share with the public. So I'll read that now. I regret I'm unable to attend this evening's meeting in person. Thankful to the mayor for delivering my message as a proud representative of our district on the Lafayette Paris school board. I'm thrilled about the continued progress we're seeing across our schools and youngsville. Not only in academics and school culture, but in the investments being made into our facilities. I believe that this is a very important investment, which I believe is truly transformative is the construction of the new Southside high school sharks athletic stadium. This long overdue project represents more than just bricks and mortar. It's a testament to the pride, growth and spirit of youngsville. We'll be a state of the art facility, one that our students, families and the entire community can be proud of. When it opens next school year, it will elevate school spirit and community engagement to new heights. I'm especially grateful to my fellow school board members for recognizing the significance of this project and supporting the funding necessary to bring it to life with so many pressing needs across our district. I'm very grateful to the state of the city for the support and support that we have to give to the students and students that are going to be able to get to this endeavor speaks volumes. This stadium will be among the premier high school athletic facilities in Louisiana and I cannot wait to see our students take the field supported by community that believes in them and in the future of public education. Thank you for your continued support and partnership and build in a stronger youngsville for generations to come and happy teacher appreciation week to all of our educators. I'm proud to be a head of the state of the city of Hodoggo and I told you earlier today but I think it's worth saying again I have never been more proud of the state of education and this out all of our schools across the city of youngsville. When you go into the campuses, the leadership, it's electric. It's been truly transformative. We had great schools before but now we have really incredible schools. I know that I've experienced and I know that it starts at the top so kudos to the school board members. We're also with Ms. Hannah Smith Mason today. Thank you for me. Kisha, thank you for being here and for allowing your husband to make his day even longer. Mr. Romero. I'm going to sit up and go on my own how excited I am but you made a comment you have a long way to go in a short amount of time you've gone a long way under your administration. I can't wait to see what the next several years hopefully you're around for that because I Scott I mean you're definitely your administration's bringing trust back to LPSS which is great for youngsville because we have such great private schools, charter schools and public schools and they needed that so thank you for what you are doing. Thanks Mr. Romero. Ms. Shampine. Thank you. Thank you. Super intended. I just want to thank you for your leadership and and I know that the rest of this state is going to follow your your lead. So thank you for what you're doing. We appreciate it. All right. Thank you appreciate the great job. All right. Is Miss Jennifer Newgent here this evening. She's not here. Okay. Miss Creed. I'd like to acknowledge Miss Jamie Creed to come on up. Miss Creed's the president of our local rotary club and former interim council member. So welcome back. Thank you. Thank you, Mary and council. I want to tell her one about this great group of kids here from Arca Interact Club this year. Just put it simple. They have been on fire. They have been volunteer in St. Joseph's diner. They did keeping youngsville beautiful. They also attended their first interact district conference and pulled home with multiple awards for their first conference. These students have gone above and beyond in service and leadership and their energy commitment and heart for the community truly reflects in their spirit of rotary and we could be proud of everything they've accomplished and also like to give a very special thank you to Miss Chasson their club sponsor. She's a very good outstanding. Her guidance, passion and support have been instrumental in the club success this year and to the members of the Arc Interact Club keep shining, keep serving and keep inspiring and we can't wait to see what you do next. And one of the members also has something to say. Yes, ma'am. Hello, I'm Kylie Brussard and I have the honor of serving as the president of the Arc A High Interact Club this past year we have accomplished many things. We started in October and took off rolling through partnering with St. Joseph's diner on many occasions. We have reached the community directly by cleaning and serving food. We have also participated in young school city cleanups and donated decorated boxes with Thanksgiving meals to those in need. Our first time attending convention was a huge success. We placed second for our skit and third in our scrapbook and our very own Aiden Nugent is now the central district representative. Interact is a place to meet people with the same intentions and souls as you. Interact has opened many doors for me teaching me selflessness and furthering my leadership. I love the way I'm able to reach different parts of my community through this club. Thank you rotary club of youngsville and citizens of youngsville for your continuous support throughout the year. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Amer. As a fellow Rotarian, Miss Chasson, thank you for always being one of the first people to volunteer and reach out to us.

I just wanted to bring a couple of the new officers up here. Give citizens an idea what's going on with the department with three new officers. Victor Gidry, Shane S. Raff and Brandon Barker. Brandon is assigned to his SRO at Southside. Shane is still in field training right now. He just got out of the academy last month. He was number two cadet out of the academy doing a great job. Victor is assigned to patrol. He just finished the field training officer phase of the department. So he's on his own at this time. Victor comes from the all field. Yes.

On behalf of Crude de Carriano, I wanted to extend our heartfelt thank you to the city of Youngsville for all I want to host this event. The second BYUB hamburger and hot dog festival at the beautiful slim go amp at the theater. It was Sunday, April the 13th. We especially want to recognize and thank Mr. Kim. Miss Haley from the city of Youngsville and Mr. Josh from the Youngsville Parks and Recreation Department. Your willingness, patience and hands on involvement throughout the entire planning and execution of the event made everything possible. And we're so grateful for your partnership. It really, really helped us. A special shout out goes to Chief JP and the Youngsville Police Department, but not only keeping us safe, but also, you know, participating in the fun. Although you didn't get to take home the belt this year. We'll be nice and warm for you and Bruce R. Yeah, absolutely. We'll get to do it again. We will. So we also wanted to thank all of our amazing sponsors this year. We had like over 23 general sponsors that were just more than willing to help. And their involvement enthusiasm. Of course, not necessarily what happened without the incredible work of our Crude de Carriano members. We had over 55 members that showed up to help. And the crowd. And it was a very unique, and you know, the most important thing to know and make the event, you know, just so much, you know, easier to, to navigate through. In addition, we had 27 cooking teams, including a fantastic local businesses, master drain, Mr. Todd, the hangout sports bar, quality companies, and black bull, and Waltz whatever. We had over 37 vendors offering everything from candles, cutting boards, 3D printed items, sweet seasons, and even a doggy clothing. And we had over 30 of them. We're all from the Youngsville and Bruce R. So it was really happy about that. We're already looking ahead to next year as we have two huge headliners already booked. We have an expanded children's corner coming in. We're going to do a kids cooking competition. And new for next year, we're going to do a spicy man challenge. And we got some more details of that coming. So we hope to see everybody next year. Please feel free to contact myself for any crew members if you guys have any suggestions, any questions, or anything that we can do. And we'll definitely be in touch once again. Thank you so much for allowing us to do this event. It was really good. Well, we love having it here. And by being out there that day, I mean, I was thoroughly impressed at the effort of the entire crew. So it's exactly the type of event we envision to have in that space. So thank you for bringing it to life and choosing to have it in our community with us. So look forward to seeing you next year. Thank you. And thank you for the contribution to the police department. Thank you, Charles. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Agenda item 4.1 approval of the meeting minutes April 10, 2025. Okay. Motion by Council Member Romero.

Motion. Second. Please call the vote. Mr. Bulljiano. Yes. Mr. Romero. Yes. Mr. Nailan. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Ms. Barraz. Yes. Motion approved. Okay. 6.1 is a request for a preliminary plet-approval of Park Bonan. I see. I saw Mr. Phil Devis, the developer here, his engineers, here, Jimmy Ricks. And we have a letter in our packet that I know Garrett Noel prepared. So, okay. Garrett, you're going to. All right. Let's do it. Good evening, Mayor and the council. I come before you to present a preliminary plet-approval of a post-development called Park Bonan. For those who don't know, there's a big empty lot on Bonan Road. Across the street from Palfrey Parkway. That's protected to be developed. The area of question is mainly going to be for commercial development. And then the implied part in the future will eventually be like a mixed use resident commercial area. In my letter, I recommend that we approve the reply on their certain conditions. Okay. Want to. Okay. They show the road district line for 200 feet, but it's really 400 feet. Is that a little change? Most of the NSR like typos and missing items. The key thing I'm noticed is how the private road is structured, property-wise. Usually the roads are its own entity and you have the right of ways. So rounding it. But the plot shows the boundaries, this kind of boot of center, I'm concerned about potentially utility developments in the back half. And I also recommend no waivers to revisions in the ADIC report. And that includes labeling the private road as private street with a proper name. And bone at road is all on the state highway. They want to remove that destination. And as such. Ask for a plat and subdivision conditions. I recommend no waivers to the conditions that are featured in the ADIC report. Some major spots that require a little attention. We need to provide 10th foot utility servitudes along all lots, border and public and private roadways and servitude niches at all property corners. And there's also a request for a traffic impact analysis. It's trapped in a rated is greater than 100 trips per hour. And they also do request a stub out street along the back along the Mexican road. It currently shows a call to sack for those don't see the flat. And I'll now open the council for questions and comments. I'll just go ahead and get a quick look at the comments. All right. For those of you that don't know, Garrett, Garrett, Noel is one of our engineers. And he's also our floodplain manager. So Garrett, thank you for being here to review. I guess let's see Mr. Romero. Gary, great job. Developers here. Yes, Mr. Is there any variance requests that you know or anything? Those variances. We're given to me. Okay. We'll give them a moment maybe in Syria. Yeah. Y'all are welcome to come up. Gary will step just to the side and be available for us. Hi, I'm Jimmy Rick with Southeast engineers. This is Phil Devy, the property owner. We are, excuse me, not requesting any waivers from the ADR, ADRC report or the additional comments. I did want to make a point of clarity. Garrett mentioned the property lines. This is a private roadway. And title lines are intended. We're intentionally gone to the center of the road. Okay. It is. There is a right of passage, right of way for private use. But the, but the fee title will go to the center of the road. And that is not uncommon. This particular area that is unplatted. You'll notice the common area is contiguous. Common area for with the half of the road going to the southern end of the property. And that is all going to be HLA owned property. But that's just a point of clarity in his question. I did send him an exhibit showing how that parcel, little clarity on that parcel. But anticipate technical questions after public comment. If you have anything for me, please let me know. All right. Thank you, Mr. Rick. Thank you. Mr. Devy, anything just high level before we end the questions? I mean, I don't want to over share anything about your project. But I know that we've had some conversations about it. Yeah. No, I mean, I don't know if, obviously, there's some people in the crowd that have questions about it. So I'm open to answer any of all questions. So I'm honored to be here. And it's my first opportunity to do a development, youngsville. So I'm looking forward to the process and looking forward to this project. All right. Well, thank you, sir. And I have a feeling we'll circle you back in. And council, just so if in case you all haven't seen it, I am circulating a petition that our office received July of 2023. I believe it was some of the residents on maxi do high-head submitted it to our office. At the time, we knew that there would be a public notification process. And that's kind of that's what we're obviously doing here. I didn't verify if it's still the same ownership group. I don't think there's been too much turnover if any in that particular neighborhood. I don't want to submit that into the into the conversation. Pam, anything on your end before? Not yet? No. Okay. That's great. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just the high level. I can tell you the petition is relative to the stuff out this stuff out the street that would be coming into the developer does own. A lot on maxi do on in today the way it's the proposal that the council has is basically it's a piece of open property day and it's basically just a what would you call that like a turnaround like almost like a call to sack for the for the private road. And that's not surprising. I mean that committee when they review it connectivity is always the theme. You know, it's I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but there's a lot of there's some people that. We have a traffic, you know, issue as we continue to grow. So connectivity is one of the things that planners and reviewers always look for in terms of providing, you know, the more access the better. And the question that you have before you isn't really unique to this development. It's, you know, the surrounding neighbors compared to best practice for planning and design. So I guess we can open it up for public comment at this point unless there's any member of the council that has any comments prior to doing so. Is there any any anyone that wishes to address the council about the proposed subdivision of property. Yes, ma'am, give you welcome to come up. And I'm going to go ahead and get three or three maxi and my biggest concern is what is with the development of the flooding. Because already we flood and it's getting worse as the rain. And I know we can't predict the mother nature, but what is the plans with the development for the properties surrounding of the flooding. And I think that's a very question valid concern and one that I would have also I can tell you just high level and we have three engineers in the room that can that can dial in a little bit further if we need. What what what's before the council today is basically just the decision about if you want to take. And one one piece of property and allow there to be a subdivision is like basically created into two very preliminary based on the council's decision tonight. Should it move forward then the developer and his design team would be tasked with creating plans that would. And that's the development plans that would encompass pretty stringent drainage requirements as one and that is one of the requirements that's I know. Garrett just kind of hit you know some high levels, but one of the requirements is that they have to do a design there. That would in essence. So that's basically utilize some of the property there for stormwater detention. So once Mr. Rick's prepares that it'll come to our office for Garrett and Pam to review to ensure that it meets the applicable ordinances. So at this point there hasn't been any type of design done. I mean Mr. developer can probably tell you maybe what his intention is as far as use of the property. And you can certainly expect that in a lot of in a lot of areas where we have new development. It's actually can be a improvement to drainage because for instance the channel that comes through that we were emailing about. We don't dictate the means and methods of how they detain the water but I could see a scenario where they may. So why didn't that and actually do something there that would hold their stormwater back in certain events so. But it's just it's very preliminary. That's my biggest thing. It's just deflated. Rightly so. So that's a lot. Thanks. Yeah. Any I mean any. Pam will. Sure. Yeah. We will be reviewing it. We've already given Mr. Rick's the models that we have that we've been using for our detention so that anything he does has to take into account. What we have so that he gives it back to us so that we can see how the development affects it. Okay. And so he will not be the development won't be allowed to negatively impact it. Okay. And I mean just as recent as a couple of weeks ago Mr. Rick submitted a drainage study on a different project and kudos to Mr. Rick's to be the first local engineer that got it done without any comments to go back. So so he knows what we require and and and make no mistake. He's going to make sure that it gets done and look I flooded before so I'm not going to I don't want anybody to ever go through what I did. So we have your best interests apart. And in Pam I know it was late this afternoon but I sent you an email from a resident that this was Miss Como here that was. Had some questions about the drainage so I just wanted to leave it in on it. Yeah. I just want to take knowledge. But yes thank you. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. All right. Thank you, man. Any any other comment from the public anyone you serve you're all going to come forward. Good. Good. I'm going to come forward. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So we don't want another exit coming to I would subdivisions and anything you can do for us we'd really appreciate it. You know, I've been living under for over 40 years and so I have some of my neighbors, you know, as a veteran that I've got another property owner. He's a veteran and you know very little has ever been done to help us out. As a veteran, you know, I've done what I needed to do for this country. Now I'm just asking you for some help. I have a one on the board. We've greatly appreciated. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Johns. Yes, sir. If you want to add. So my name's Tyler Gilbo, and the property of 312. I'm actually on the road. My biggest concern is what is the intended use of the property? Secondly, statistically speaking, when you bring in more people to a space, there's a potential for more things to go wrong, meaning theft, noise, any disruptions like that. We already have plenty of noise that we receive when Chigamopan host events, when events take place at the bar on the corner. We've got enough vehicle traffic on the road already with commercial vehicles from the private business down the street, going up and down the street. We've got semi-sculpting through the neighborhood already. We've got people with pets in the neighborhood who've got kids in the neighborhood. My biggest concern is if we increase the traffic flow, we're going to increase the risk of injury. And I spent 10 years in the fire department here. I've seen kids get hit in a residential neighborhood by a vehicle even going to speed limit. So I know what can happen. That's our biggest concern is we don't want extra vehicle traffic in the neighborhood. So like Mr. Wayne was saying, as veterans, we want to ensure the safety of our neighborhood. Yes, sir. Appreciate the feedback. Thank you, Mr. Jones. Anyone else wishing to address the council? Yes, ma'am. Hi, how are you? Hello. I'm Toby Tibito, and I am a property owner on Brawls Street, and that's in Chigamopan. And I've got some neighbors here also that are on the back up to Bonan. And I'm so sorry, but I'm from North Louisiana. So I do not have the Cajun accent. I do not know the names of some of these streets properly. But I did marry Koonas. But anyway, my biggest concern is that I'll give you, for instance, our home appraised for right at $1 million. And this is before the house that's on the older home with all the property, that was for sale for a long, long time. And I just assumed that, hey, somebody's going to buy this house and make it a home state or something. We didn't know. But now that it's going to be commercial, would appreciate a little bit clarity on what is going to be the most comfortable place for the city. And I think that the noise is horrible anyway. And again, our backyard, I mean, we're in the state section of Chigamopan. And we, the majority of us on that street have, it's the largest lots in Chigamopan. We all have pools. And so it's, I just would like to know what exactly commercial is going to be one level? Is it going to be two level? Because if it's two level, you're looking right in our backyards. And not only that, we've had tons of issues with my husband and I, we were not even in our home the first weekend we were in our home, our car's got broken into. And it was from the trailer park kids coming over. And so my biggest fear is, OK, so we've got commercial on the first two lots. What's going to be developed on the back two lot? Is this going to be an upper scale neighborhood? Is this going to be another trailer park? Is this, you know, we would just like some, as homeowners, we would like some clarity of what's going on in our backyard, basically. So if we could get clarity, I mean, that would really help us a lot. Yes, ma'am. Well, thank you for your comments. We love having you here. We think your phase of Sheremo Pond's a great addition to the community. So just high level, I can just speak relative to the ordinance. I mean, in terms of a mobile home park that wouldn't be allowed relative to commercial, youngs will just have an ordinance at the 400 foot frontage of that property now has to be commercial. Now, commercial can be a myriad of things that can be professional office space, that could be medical, it could be banking, it doesn't. It could be, I mean, I'm just speculating in terms of that. Because we all think that we, well, depending upon the use of it, there would be buffer requirements. Because there are still houses that are going to be to the south, like the homes all in Maxi do. So the type of business would have to be complimentary to the homes that are there. And what I mean by that is, for example, if it's a pipe yard, just using it as an example, not to pick on a pipe yard. I mean, we put a lot of oil businesses here, and it drives our economy. But a pipe yard in certain areas doesn't make the most sense. The way our ordinance would handle that is to say you can put it there, but you need this much of a green belt surrounding it. So a developer would look at it and say, you know what, for the price of the property that I've paid for this, a pipe yard isn't really going to be the most conducive thing here. Now a neighborhood business, let's just say like a bank, a medical office, something that's going to lend itself to be more daytime use, that buffer would be limited to probably like 10 or 20 feet because it's not really an obnoxious land use. It's not going to be like a tobacco discount place or anything like that. I mean, it's open 24, 7 pretty much, and you've got traffic just non-stop. We already have a traffic issue on bone end now. That's, we could just get a little bit more clarity. And one story, you know. Fair comments. Thank you, man. Is there any other public comment from the public? Mr. Romero. Go back to that petition. I know everybody saw it, but just for public knowledge, it looks like adding all the houses up on those two roads, 100% of the homeowners saw in the petition. For the connective. For the, for not connecting, not connecting. The road to stub out. Yeah. OK, thank you, sir. Mr. Nile and would you mind if I take the public comment for? Yes, sir. Not as much, I guess, a comment. But, I mean, we trust the process, which I've done throughout the community, but I guess I'm here more hoping to hear from the developer what he plans on doing because communication. I got was just just a letter. Yeah, not much more than that. So I was just here. Hopefully you find out what the things were. That's all I have. The in- I'm sorry, your name, please. Brian, Brian Wilson. Mr. Brian Wilson. All right. Thank you, sir. Mr. Nile. That's, that's what I had. I'd rather just let the developer speak. I might as well know what is, what, what is he thinking in this area? Because that's going to kind of help make decisions. Mr. Devin. So yeah, I appreciate the questions. I completely understand the concerns, the questions that come with it. It's part of the process. I guess just a little background. I came here in 1996. Canada originally, my mom's a French teacher, came here for a French teacher's conference. And she knew I wanted to play baseball. And she made it a point to go find the college coach, not knowing anything about USL at the time. That's a great hat, by the way. And she got a ride from another teacher that she met, those from Crowley, to go to the baseball field and introduce herself to Tony Robyshow. And my mom, there's barely five feet tall. She barely speaks English, but showed up and got his business card. And I called him every day for two weeks until he finally said, look, if you can find your way down here, I'll let you try out. And so I came here not knowing anything about Lafayette, really not knowing much about Louisiana. And then that was it. I brought my hockey skates and my hockey equipment. In case I didn't make the baseball team, I heard there was ice skaters at the time, but I came, made the team, and made as a freshman, and got my first college win against LSU at their place. And ever since then, I've really never left. I don't plan on going anywhere. I love this city. The one thing my dad told me before I came, and I hate to pick on you, Mr. Mayor, but you mispronounced my last name. And that goes along with my story. My dad, when I came, he said, I'm a high school teacher. I'm not leaving with a bunch of money. I'm not leaving with a giant estate. But the only thing I'm giving you is my last name. And when you go there, I looked, I did the research. There's not a single DV in the entire area. So when you show up, you're the only DV that anybody knows. Don't screw it up. So I've taken that to heart since day one, and I really believe that my intentions are not to do anything that is going to negatively impact drainage, negatively impact the way of life. I live here. I mean, my kids go to a extension. I live in Lafayette. I mean, there's some people in this room that I already know. So I can't look someone in the face and say that I'm making a profit on a development on the backs of other people. That's not going to happen. So to tell you what I'm doing with this property, I have a vision. Is it going to come to fruition? I don't know, but I know what we're starting with. So we have a deal in place with a medical office, internal medicine. It's with the hospital here, a 9,000 square foot building on the front left hand corner of the property, single story. My plan from the beginning in this property is, what can I do to enhance things in young's build that are not being offered? And I'd be crazy to try to compete with Sugar Mill pond. But what don't they have that I could bring to the table? There's not many options for office, for people that maybe want to own their own piece of property to have their architectural studio, a CPA, whatever it might be. I want to be able to bring that to the table. Medical use. I'm a real estate broker as well. And some of the issues I hear from people that own restaurants and some of those services in Young's Vale is there's not much of a lunch crowd. I mean, you can see the turnover on some restaurants here that people are living here, but they're not staying here for work. So it's a component that's missing. My goal is when I invest in something, especially to this degree, it has my name on it. It means a lot. So the start is a 9,000 square foot building. I told the architects that the design and what is going to look like, it has to be equivalent or better. Feel like it's an extension of Sugar Mill pond. And that's what it's going to look like, essentially. We don't have models or 3D renderings yet, but that's kind of starting to come together. The other side of the property would be a kind of a retail office use, single story. We've got a little area for maybe a coffee shop. I've had some discussions with a few great companies that would be attractive to people that live in Young'sville to go to. More to the rear portion. Well, we're going to have two big detention ponds with fountains. It's called Park Bonay, because I want to have a park like setting in there somewhere where if you're at the medical clinic or at a doctor's office, and kind of walk out, have a little gazebo, like a nice little kind of park atmosphere, and then have some plots of land, some small parcels that someone could buy and have their own office in there. So that's in essence the game plan. But the rear portion of the land, I don't know yet, our focus is on the front parcel. And we'll just see how things kind of develop. But the one thing I can assure you all is my intentions are not to do anything that will not allow me to look at each one of you in the face at the grocery store, coffee shop, or whatever it might be, and have someone disappointed, upset, or mad because of something that I did that has drastically affected the quality of life. That's not my intentions, and that's not what I'm going to do. So I don't know if that answers some questions. But the only thing I know with certainty is a medical office, 9,000 square feet single story. And I told them it has to look like it belongs in Sugar Mill pond. And so those plans are in the works right now. Yes, sir? I live in the back from homeowner on copyrights drop. Yes, sir. I live in the back of the truck. The other side, which I'm going to do with that yet? No. I want to show you a change. What I'm hoping happens is that we get a lot of traction. We get a lot of traction with selling parcels to people that want to build for an office for themselves. But it's a big parcel. So I don't know if there's enough demand for it yet. So more than likely that parcel in the back is going to remain without being developed for a good while until the fronted parcel kind of identifies what it's going to be. Let me share this, Mr. DV. Thank you. You've never corrected me all these years. Or if you have my apology at it now. I was saving it for the story. OK, it was a good story. So the remaining property behind these four proposed lots is remaining unplatted. So any use there, because it's unplatted, would be coming and have a similar process to this, in which you would be notified if you are an adjacent landowner. So I appreciate Mr. DV sharing his vision. But that's not being sub-divided. It will still be, it's still marked as unplatted. So there's no action. I'm sorry. Yes, ma'am. I hate to interrupt. I hate to interrupt. We have people that are streaming watching. So if you wouldn't mind coming up to the microphone just so they could hear the. Who are the else? I think they develop why now. Yeah. We can't hear the question. But I don't mind. Maybe I can try to listen and restate it out of the room. I can give out the question. Yeah, if you don't mind. Yeah. We live right behind this fence, they have a background. And about two years, it has completely become a kind of spill-based now. But the public is that because we always put this effect to the, it becomes very much overgrown. We have to go to the bottom to cut our gas. So we have to do that. That's about three years now. We go to water. OK. And the thing is, that's a way of not holding. OK. And it would take now two hours. So the question is about a tree at the back fence line. Yes, sir. Is it the track that does cut back there every now and then? It can't get back there close enough to cut through. But it still comes on. Yeah. Well, I have, we've been planning on getting a tree service company back there to start clearing out like all the, whether it's that particular tree, everything else to clean up everything in the back. Then we catch rain. We try to go back there. We catch rain again. And then these plans started happening. But that'll be addressed 100% and I'll make sure to get that on that as soon as possible, for sure. Can we get your name? Can we get your name? OK. I got it. We think. You have to say it right behind. Yep. I see it. Right behind the front. I don't live. Here is a see what we're going to be developing. Sure. Well, we'll, Mr. Devy has future plans forward and it becomes plated. You'll be notified again. So. Mr. Nylon. Mr. Devy, I just want to start off saying that I love the idea with the brand in medical. I think that could be a huge thing here. Someone who has a background in medical. I was speaking with someone this morning, actually, who said how, when he first moved here trying to find a PCP in this area, it was difficult or a primary care physician. I know, personally, I have to drive into Lafayette. It would be ideal to have one that I could go here. They have a couple, but it would, with the size city that we have to bring in more medical professionals and giving people a choice is huge. Especially bringing in any type of specialist as well instead of having to go fight the traffic within Lafayette. So I do appreciate that. The question that I have with the way that this is set up with the three lots, I know that you just mentioned that you're focusing on that front section and developing that. As far as the road is concerned and getting that road laid, is that something that has to be done at this time? Could it be only up to a certain point to where we would then have to make that decision on the cul-de-sac versus the stub out? Because I think what comes into play here is if we make that decision on the cul-de-sac versus the stub out, and then business booms or whatever, and then you end up developing that future phase that's unplotted, then we run into an issue where we have tons of traffic that's trying to come out of one area dumping onto Bona, and then we lose that ability from a development standpoint. So that's the thing that's in my head. I understand the concerns of the citizens that live in that area, but whenever I look at it from, when this entire area is developed, and we lose that ability of a stub out, then we're having everyone from that one area and everyone from Maxi Dullion dumping out on the Bona. It's gonna be an extreme cluster right there. So just throwing that out there, does it have to go that far right now? Could it be addressed later when you have a more or a better idea of what that future phase may look like? I understand the point of your question. What's being presented on the plat for preliminary plat approval is the plat with conditions. It's if it's approved with the plat conditions, that's how the action letter would be written and would require the connection, whether it's in this phase or next, but because that's only hearing tonight, I think that question should be addressed tonight, unless I'll have a way to navigate that, but the plat as presented shows the cul-de-sac, so it would be approved with the conditions of the ADRC or amended as you guys see fit. I think you're bringing a great question to the table. I think what I'm before, just to, I can appreciate it, what you're saying is may not be necessary today, but if we save that decision if and when the back is it developed, I think is what I'm. We would love to be able to modify that decision, but I think as the action is tonight, it would probably need to be addressed. Yeah. I don't have anything. Okay, thanks. Mr. Bulljana. Yeah, the only other, I guess, just from a first responder aspect and maybe an avid traffic driver, this countless areas in our community where I feel like when we run into these traffic circles and traffic jams, I feel like everyone's looking for the next way out to kind of DBA traffic and whatnot. And the last thing I would want to do would be to make a cut through for traffic to have heavy flow. However, for the time being, I think like a middle ground would be us put like some sort of like a security gay, almost like a key card access. Almost where emergency first responders could access the backside of the community versus having to go through. No, eventually we're gonna have that roundabout at that intersection and that's gonna be a bit of a traffic jam just from exiting Sugarwell pond and whatnot. But in the event that you don't, we don't end up wanting to use the stuff out, at least there's an access for us to gain through that the time being if we don't decide to do the coldest act route. I can't predict the future and what traffic was gonna look like in any year from now. At the point you're making is part of the interconnectivity. Yeah, part of the principles of interconnectivity. Yeah, what happens all the time? We run in calls and we get stuck in 60 cars deep and we're just gonna sit there and create more of a traffic jam trying to get through. And I hate to be for it to be a business that's got to be a business on fire or someone need a medical attention and whatnot. But those things are gonna happen. So those kinds of things that leave you in me but also don't wanna be trying to create more of a problem with traffic just trying to flow through Maxi D'O'on with 200 cars. So I don't know what the less of the evil is gonna be but I think having access to the time being maybe is a middle ground until we decide what the future development may be. You know, I don't think, great point. I don't think the developer or his engineer have an issue with making the connection. I think the hesitation on the connection is based on the feedback of the residents that are in the neighborhood. So the developer has not, they're only simply asking for clarification because it's a private road and the amount of easement that I think Garrett and Pam took note and understood. So I mean, perhaps another solution, I mean, or just for discussion could be, I mean, if your intention was to build it as a bubble there, like a turnaround, I mean, as long as you still own that property, if you come back to develop the back, I mean, that cul-de-sac may be required to connect in if that's another scenario. Yeah, well, there was Rushmore. Rushmore was a cul-de-sac and now there's a connection there. So North Rushmore, or just Rushmore, I think. The concern is, the concern would be is obviously that plat probably only holds 10, 12 homes, average homes, but if you come with town homes, apartments, something like that, it's a game changer. It's far as traffic, concern. I mean, if I'm sitting here and you're trying to apply this right now and you're saying, hey, it's gonna be a 15 or 16, 18 homes. I have no problem with not connecting, but if it's apartment complex or a 40 town homes, that's gonna start adding up. And I'm not trying to detour you from wanting to do that in the future, but I think the mayor's got a great idea is that obviously it's pretty unanimous with the maxidion residents and everything that we don't connect that at this time. And I would agree with that, but depending on what that future development is, we'll depend on what we do in the future connecting it. And I think also those residents will be contacted again as well. And we can cross that bridge when we get there. Which I have to question. Oh, sorry. We understand the point. We understand the concern of the residents. We don't mind the connection. That's why we did not object to the ADRC report. Both ways, it also allows exit from the maxidio residents to get to that west side as an additional outlet. Oh, I completely agree. I think that, I mean, look, I respect the residents that have lived there. Some of them, I know for that's their generational home. Nothing but respect, I think. I mean, I can tell you examples throughout the city where we've missed opportunity for connectivity. And I can also tell you areas where connectivity has benefited unbeknownst to them at the time, everyone that's in it. So I think that's why it's just, I think that's kind of why it's delicate. I do think for what Mr. D.V. is describing today, medical offices, 9,000 square feet, daytime use, that is one use I just would be hesitant to mix it. We don't know what's ever happening in the back yet. So if you lose that opportunity based on your decision today, you may lose it forever. I mean, unless I'm missing something, I mean, if you were to accept it as it's drawn, there is no connection. But if it comes back, I mean, it's a turn around of a private street. I think the issue is, if I may, is that by saying that and Gary did the right thing, by saying we accept everything from the ADRC, that's his recommendation. So I think what Mr. Ricks was getting after is, if you're wanting him to do it like the cul-de-sac, then you have to say that you don't want that ADRC comment to be. So again, for you guys, originally they had, when we met with them before they ever did it, they were going to connect. We said, hey, we took into account knowing that the residents, so they have been flexible to do either one. ADRC says connectivity. I fully understand them. You know, counseling, you know, living in a subdivision that we're gated in the back. And if you can't get around that tree, you can't get out. So you know exactly what it's like, because unless we open our gate in our subdivision, you are unable to get out when there's water around that road, which happened in the rain event two weeks ago. We also know connectivity was a good thing, because when it rained, there were some roads that you can't get through, and people had to change. And we had Walmart trucks going through, save a palms, because they couldn't get on Highway 90. Not that that's what you want. I'm just saying that when things happen, people look for an alternate route. I can tell you that, you know, if we ever get to doing that roundabout, that's going to be an area under construction. And people will want to use this when they're trying to get out of Maxi Do-Yall Road. When we're going to be doing work on Highway 90, too, I can promise you when the construction is going to be right there. So an alternate route for them to be able to move would be good. But either way, we will make them comply with whatever the decision is. Just if you want the flexibility, again, we can do just, I mean, last month, remember, you guys gave us the flexibility to work with them as to what was best. You can put in there that at this time, you don't want it to be connected, but you want to reserve the right for later on could. It's up to you guys. But yes, if it comes back, just know that if it comes back and you decide at that point, then you would have to tell them to make the connection through the common area. They are reserving in this common area, just so you guys know it is distinguished as common area. If you don't know, then say that you want that common area to remain. We wouldn't want him to put a building. It says common area right now, where we wouldn't want somebody to take interest and want to switch the common area. And then there's a building that leaves us no potential to be able to do it. So I think if you guys want to put that you don't want it now, but that what you do know is you want that area to remain common for that flexibility in place, too, then you'll just have to make that exception to the comments that they've got it made. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be flexible. I understand what they want, understand what you guys want, and understand what could possibly happen. Yeah, common area wouldn't be addressed to where we wouldn't be able to build anything on it. Correct, the common area won't be addressed. So you have it as common area. So if you want it to stop, then you do have to declare that because otherwise Mr. Riggs has to connect it. You know, ultimately short term, while I say short term, nothing is short in this, in this from travel to the ground to completion, but we're looking at the feasibility of whether we build out the road completely in the first phase. I think more than likely we're not going to, that we're going to focus on the medical building, and then that second plot developing that into retail office, and then that's kind of a third phase. And if there's market demand for it, at that point, we look to build the road. I think ultimately long term, and I can't make promises for anything, but what I'm envisioning is actually being a benefit to that cut through for that neighborhood because there will be services there that will be easy access. I think it'll be like the quality of what's going to be built and what's going to be there. I think it's going to be beneficial to that neighborhood and having a connectivity, I think, will help enhance the neighborhood. But you know, that's one person's opinion. But that's kind of how I see things play out for this development. Okay. It's a pleasure, the council, Mr. Niley. So I'm going to take a swing at this and just say that I will motion to approve with the exception to number 16 where the stub out street. It can still be dedicated, but does not connect to Maxi Duillon at this time until the future phase unplotted is brought forth. Is that possible? Thanks, so your motion is to accept the report as presented, except removing condition 16 on the ADRC report, which is the stub out streets required to be dedicated, constructed to the south towards Maxi Duillon, reserving that as common area, saving the opportunity for it to be a condition of the unplated property to the east. That right. All right. So motion by Councilor Nylon. All right. Second by Councilman Barraz. Is there any further council comment? Yes, sir, Mr. Rivera. It pertains to this and I apologize. I forgot Yel's last name. Any time residents, citizens have an issue with trees, overgrowth, some of that. If you go to Youngsville.us at the top, report a problem. And then it gets filtered to the mayor's staff and the appropriate department, and they can reach out from there. No, no, but they'll find out for you. They'll handle the sit, they'll work with you and that lay in order to, I'm just saying that on behalf of everybody watching and everybody in the audience. Yeah. I live down the street from, so I'll take care of that. All right. Is there any public comment relative to the motion in the second? Okay, this motion second. No public comment additional. Ms. Gidr, please call the vote. Mr. Romero. Yes. Mr. Nylon. Yes. Ms. Schulfine. Yes. Ms. Barraz. Yes. Mr. Volgiano. Yes. Motion approved. Well, Mr. Devy, we are excited. I didn't want to influence the council's vote on this. Other than just to say that I can tell the council and the public every time I meet with you. It's, I don't necessarily remember what you say, but I do remember how I feel and I think that that's indicative of from the meetings with Haley and I, we know that you know what the needs are in our community. When we've had questions about how to do development, I'm going to say town homes just because I know that you've done town homes in other areas. You've made yourself available to help us with other ordinances to help model developments after the work that you've done. So we're grateful that you choose them to work here in our community. So thank you. All right, agenda item 7.1 is to proclaim May 11 through 17, 2025 as economic development week. Actually, I'm going to let Haley do it. So can I give it back to you? Okay. Sure. I read a line. I don't know about that. Well, thank you. Haley Leatherwood. I'll work in the mayor's office. And I'm here to proclaim economic development week May 11 through 17, 2025, whereas the International Economic Development Council, IEDC, is the largest professional economic development organization dedicated to serving economic developers. And whereas the International Economic Development Council provides leadership and excellence in economic development for communities, members, and partners through conferences, training courses, advisory services, and research, in-depth publications, public policy advocacy, and initiatives such as the accredited economic development organization program and the certified economic development designation, and the entrepreneurship development professional. And whereas the economic developers promote economic wellbeing and quality of life for their communities by creating, retaining, and expanding jobs that facilitate growth, enhance wealth, and provide a stable tax base. And whereas the Lafayette Economic Development Authority, Leather, is proud, is a proud and active member of IEDC, engaging in the best practices led by IEDC and having two IEDC-certified economic developers on staff. And whereas Leather has received three IEDC gold awards for its creative business retention, workforce development, and entrepreneurship initiatives, and a silver award for its re-entry workforce development efforts. And whereas the mission of the Lafayette Economic Development Authority is to catalyze job growth and capital investments that will lead to a strong and diversified economy, equitable access to economic opportunity, and an excellent quality of life in Lafayette Parish. And whereas Leather creates innovative collaborations between business, government, educational institutions, and workforce development organizations to produce a rich network of support that fuels progress. And whereas Leather provides resources and guidance to support businesses as they make decisions to start, expand, or relocate to Lafayette Parish. And whereas Leather engages in the best practices in business retention and expansion, business traction, workforce development, and talent attraction by fostering entrepreneurship and small business development, by curating a positive business climate and by engaging in efforts to enhance quality of life in the Parish. Now therefore, it be resolved that the City of Youngsville, Louisiana, recognizes the week of May 11th through May 17th, 2025 as economic development week and reminds individuals of the importance of this community celebration of the practice of economic development which supports expanding business and career opportunities and making lives better. It's signed by Mayor Ritter. Thank you. I'd like to ask Mark to come up and join Haley and present the proclamation and feel free to floor yours, Mark. Mark is, where's a lot of hats, but he's our liaison on a Lathe economic development authority for the City of Youngsville and it's a pleasure to work with him from our office. So, much to work with you all. And as a council, you all should know, well, I guess I was excited in the back because we talk about retail, we talk about daytime workers that need to be here in the City of Youngsville and so when I heard that there was a development of either medical or some type of office, I was sitting back there really, really excited because we have talked about that. We need those daytime workers to stay here so that way, obviously like he said as well, if the DV said as well, is that way the restaurants can also flourish as well. So, I was really excited and hopefully he does everything he said for the residents of Youngsville. And it is wonderful to work with these two so they are supporting and also they're representing the City of Youngsville very well. So, I want to let you know that and also Ms. Shampine, we're excited that we're going to be working with you all as well on Tuesday to talk to the Youngsville Leadership class at Red and White Day as well. So, thank you all for this. Well, perfect. Take a picture. Catherine, would you mind taking it for joining us up front? Get Jala Buñmartam to wake up. Mark, thank you very much. Appreciate it. All right. Mark, thank you for all your efforts. Appreciate it. With the help of Lida and Haley, they're working on some great things. So, I look forward to sharing more in the months ahead. All right, 7.2 Mr. Miles, Cradors, requesting a variance to the land use regulations to allow a reduction in the green belt to 5 feet into amid the requirement for our fence for an existing metal building to be used for a woodworking shop located at 118 Randy Road. Council, you have the on the back of the the agenda item request, you have the piece of property coincidentally, it's just in the same neighborhood that we just discussed around the corner from Maxi. This is a piece of property that was purchased in August. My appreciation for it is that the landowner now is wishing to lease that space out as the variance request says, lease it out to be a woodworking shop. My appreciation is that there is a storefront here in Youngsville and this would be basically the production spot. So, Mr. Cradors here, yeah, you're welcome to come up, sir. Welcome, sir, the floor is yours. Good evening, Council. My name is Miles Crador, I'm a part of Dakota Boroughs. We're the owners of the building at 118 Randy, and like you mentioned, we'd like to put Mr. Mordy-Toups, who has a storefront right behind the McDonald's in Youngsville. He's a one-man operation with occasional helper and he'd be working inside the shop from regular business hours. And also, we don't mind putting a fence up if that's neat. I don't know. Mr. Shumplin. Thank you, Mayor. I have just a few questions. It's the existing metal building that's there now is what he's going to occupy. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and there's a lot that's for sale. When you face in that building on the right, is it all of that property? It is all the property, but he'll only be utilizing the building. Okay, so do you all have plans for that lot? Not at the moment. Okay, and the drainage. There's drainage in the back. I know you're saw that. So y'all are responsible for the drainage, right? Yes, ma'am. We actually connected to city sewer, so we got off the septic tank and city water. But yes, ma'am, we have the drainage just in the back. Right. And I know there's not 20, you wanted us to relieve you of the 25-foot buffer, where there's not 25 feet. I don't think between the buildings. And you said you don't mind offense. If that would be required, where would you put offense? If we need to put offense in between the property next door. A Jason too. Okay, thank you. Great woodwork. Mr. Ramara. Hey guys, so back to fence. So to the rear of the property as well, connecting to what is that? Your one 12, no, to one 12. I think we're willing to do whatever's needed to accommodate. And then what had y'all come over five feet, coming from 25 to five? Well, that's all that's left on that side between you. Yes, ma'am. I'm looking at the map. I didn't after that. Yeah, that's what I figured. Okay. Well, that's a good question, Ms. Barr. I mean, really, we just, when we put it through the land use matrix, this was, I mean, Gary applied the land use matrix exactly as it was intended. I mean, there are some, this is one of those scenarios. I mean, just, you know, to respect for the neighbors and the neighborhood. I mean, we didn't want to make any administrative decision on it to air on that side, which is why I felt that it was appropriate to bring it before you tonight. And as there's been any discussion with permitting with the plumbing on the rear of the property, or was that priority all purchasing it? We did do all the permitting necessary to tap into the city sewer and also city water. Yeah. This is, yeah, unrelated. I think one of the inspectors maybe trying to circle back with you. I think he had a question about that because I know you did get a permit. There was a question that came to our office and I think they were going to be circling back with you. They just, I'm sorry, I just don't know the particulars, but there's something that they additional that they would need there, but just as an FYI. Absolutely. I mean, I do agree with the, I'm glad you're willing to do the fence because obviously the residents to next next of y'all, obviously, he's going to be five feet and less. I would help with, I don't know what type of woodworking cutting wood or what he might do during the day. And now on the rear of the property connecting to 112 would be what I would have seen because there's already a fence at 112 from what I'm seeing on the map. At this moment, there's no fence around the property at all. At 112? This is a side. There's no fence on the back when I'm talking about connecting this value from like Mr. James Towns. That's Erwin. Yeah, that's the one. Well, your own that lot also, right? Yes, man. I'm sorry. Yes, man. It's still a two-seater side. It's a, it's, yes, it's supposed to be just the one side. He's talking about that fence on that side connecting that right now. Yeah, I was who's on the other side of the property. Yeah. Mr. Nile. Mr. Nile. The, um, the furniture storage is going to be inside or they want the stored outside? Oh, sorry. Could you clarify? When you said furniture is being stored? The woodworking, it said some, some of his woodworking that he finishes is he going to be storing any of that outside or is it going to be in all indoor? He has a shop, a showroom, a railway hobby, also everything we get moved to there. All the, all the working in the wood will so nothing outdoors as far as we know. Yeah, I mean, I'm not, I'm not as worried about a fence all the way along the back just on between the neighbors, because I mean, that lots probably been like that for decades. So, um, I don't think that's necessarily. Miss Shumpun. Yes, sir. May I thank you. I have a motion to approve with a fence along the side between metal building and the neighbor. I don't know which, would that be? So, that's the, I guess that's the southern side, the northern side, excuse me. With a fence on that side. No, northern side. Okay. All right. Let's see. Mr. Volgiana. Seconds. Any council discussion? Mr. Romero. I think we have to, we have an opportunity here to, anytime we have new development or change in ownership development or something to do fencing along bordering properties. So, whether you own all that or not, I do think on the rear part, there needs to be some type of fencing or something to coincide with between the two. Because if there's not the other property gets sold, that property gets sold, it's going to develop in put offense. You own both, there's two sub-relights. So, I mean, it's a missed opportunity. I think fencing at all will be bringing it all together, but that would be my sub-motion to make sure we fence completely the back and rear side of the property, as well as what you motion for between the two buildings. Okay, Mr. Romero is making a substitute motion. Is there a second on the substitute motion? All right, there's no second on the substitute motion. Is there any public comment? Yes, Mr. John's, you welcome to come forward, sir. Society doing it. Like I said, my name is Maen John's. I have the adjacent property. After speaking to everyone in the neighborhood, no one wants a business coming into the neighborhood. I talked to all the homeowners and because it was right next to me, they all were all against it. I've spoken to the gentleman. I'm from my understanding because he has good intentions. But people in neighborhood just don't want another business coming into the neighborhood. Because they're saying like we open the door, we're not telling them what's going to come in down the road. And then my wife had concerns and I didn't tell him yet, but she was worried about soldiers coming our way because we're only, my pool is like 30 feet away from the building, the metal building. So that was my wife's concern. She was going to come tonight, but she couldn't make it. Anyway, I wanted to address that. And like I said, from my understanding, the man has good intentions, but no one in the neighborhood wants a business coming into the neighborhood. I spoke to several people. I tried to get some of them to come tonight and speak, but you see who's here. So anyway, that's what I wanted to say. Okay, thank you, Mr. John. Is there any other public comment? Anyone else which I don't address the council? Okay, there's a motion and a second, no public, no further public comment. Miss Kudry, please call the vote. Ms. Barrett? Yes. Mr. Bojiano? Yes.

It's up for introduction. Miss Shiongpai. I have some questions. Is the property owner here? That was the annexation. Will. Sir, yeah, come on up, sir. Good evening. Brand O'Yamma. Actually, not the property only with engineering survey and company representing my owner. Okay. There's a home on here, right? I don't see anything. So what are they going to, what do they want to do with this property? So part of her property was was already in the city of Yongezu. Okay. Yeah. I'll heard the plat. She had one parcel in the city and one parcel in the garden. Yes. She wanted to combine it. This is the second one. Are they? She, this is her. She needed to combine it first. Okay. And then because she, because they moved a trailer on it, remember, they moved a trailer on it. It was really like, and then this she wants to combine it so that she now has everything in the city. So that's what this was for. Is it water and sewer to this area? Because Bricklyph didn't know it's saying yes. Because I know that next one over, I don't think has water. Okay. Just water. Do you anticipate you? So I want to add sewer? Connect? I don't know if they can connect. They are on the way to sewer line. I'm not sure it's available, but the lot size is large enough to do a treatment. In the end of the treatment. Okay. All right. Thank you. Mr. Romero. I was going to motion to upper reward.

And then we'll go to Pam. So you have our report in front of you. The wastewater plant. We're doing the final coordination. We should be able to advertise for beds in a couple of weeks. We've got all the approvals. This would put us probably issuing the notice to proceed sometime in September and with construction completion in October of 2026. That's the goal. Pump station four. We I just sent a recommendation for substantial completion to the mayor. They just have a few items to finish up there. So that's going well. Pump station three, which is the one on Yang Street. The pumps were finally delivered on May 2nd. They're going to mobilize next week. That work shouldn't take too long. So that's going well. The water plant we're at about 62 percent complete. The filter building walls are pretty much complete. Filters are coming in in June. So that's still on schedule. We're still for the sugarmompon upgrade. We're still working with a trot and Jordan Dago to try to define the route for this new force main. The waterline interconnection, Georgia, accepted it. That went really smoothly. They have a couple of cutting boughs to put in left, but everything went well. They are very quick. Pump station five. We are still working on that. The survey is being completed probably in the next week. So any questions? Any questions for Susan? Susan handles our water and sewer and all the expansion. Maybe a good opportunity for me to share that we did LDH Louise and Department of Health. It issue the water grades for the two water systems that the City of Youngsoil operates. Proud to announce that we did receive an A on both. This is only their third year of giving a rank rankings. We did have it A last year as well on both systems, but it's worth noting that both systems did go up 12 points. So I want to commend. He's not here this evening, but I want to commend Alex Mezzarol, who is our utilities director and his team, Stetson Peters, Caden, and I believe there's another operator too that I'm leaving out. Wade, Jean Bennett. Jean Bennett, sorry. Jean Bennett, excuse me. Anyway, very proud of the accomplishments. Those guys that we've assembled a phenomenal team very conscientious water operators that have gone through all the schooling. The education that our water department has today is unprecedented in our city's history, which is very appropriate considering that we're taking that we're bringing online a new water plant that's going to be quadrupling easily, our daily production. So Susan, thank you for all your guidance and support over the years. So we're happy to have some of the water project. That's too. Yeah, we all so anyway, so congratulations to Alex and his team and Susan. Thank you for everything that you're doing. Pam. Okay, so Fortune Road, the Mill and Overlay project, that started construction today. For the next two weeks, just let from Bonan to Highway 89, we will be down to one lane. They do have traffic flaggers there. So we are, the projects being milled and overlaid under construction, I mean, under traffic. So part of why we're trying to get that done is because right after that's done is when we're going to start diverting people we should work because we're 80% done. And I say by 80% on the roundabout, we still have the other leg to do, but we will start using the roundabout and close a portion of Highway 89 in June. So that is still our target to try to do that. So you've probably noticed on Highway 89, there has been some slow and as and the same thing on Fortune. So just expect some delays. We're trying to get, you know, asphalt down. And so we can get that roundabout open and start work using that. Larivia Road, we did our pre-construction last week. So the contractor will be given notice to proceed in June right now. He's in his assembly period trying to get his, you know, start ordering things and he'll start with the submittals. But the goal is to start that one after we've got Fortune Road open and people circulating there. But again, expect that to go on for a year. I can tell you that we are just two weeks beyond one year in starting with both Highway 89 and the Fortune Road roundabout. So they have made some significant progress with what they have done on those two projects simultaneously all under, you know, under under traffic. So I might seem like longer to people, but that's pretty impressive what they've done in a year. Shima Agriab, I do have draft plans for that completed. Anselm Kool-E detention pond. We're waiting on the core permit for that one. Once we get the core permit, we can finalize environmental so that we can get clearance to make an off, to get the property appraised and make an offer to the property owner. Highway 92, the ultimate project, the expansion that we're still waiting on anything from the grant, any decisions. I think they're usually out in like June. I think that's what it was last year and what they said. But in the interim, we are working on some left turn lanes to do an interim solution that we are working on right now between Bona and St. Place. The Prescott 92 roundabout, we are 65% complete. It's probably a little bit further along with that, but because we are working through some coordinating on some drainage stuff with Sugar Mill pond plans and want to make sure with the development you guys talked to want to make sure that all of the drainage coincides with the projects. And then we're working on the tap. That's the resolution that you guys passed today and the mayor will be submitting that next week. And we will be doing, we are focused on from a little bit, a little north of Hawk two wards here, fill in towards the clock roundabout to fill in different gaps of the sidewalks. So that at least that's contiguous and then move on to other phases in other applications. So we will let them know it's a it's a face project. Any questions about, I mean a lot of moving pieces on roads. So there's a lot of stuff that's a major major event probably happening in the next 30 days where the the young so highway roundabout to Fairfield will be opening. As Pam said, just that's why the fortunes being overlaid today. Fortune from 89 to bonans being done today. The next critical path will be the roundabout opening in the road to Broussard. So if you're going north on 89 roughly around the beginning of the summer north on 89 at Fortune, you'll have to take the Fortune Fairfield connection to South Bernard or you can go east to Bonan and we're going to take as much we're trying our best to maximize the calendar while schools out for the summer to really try to do some work on the center of young so highway that's under construction today. And then as Pam said, the Lurivier project will be kicking off in June as well. So the the press got roundabout. I mean I think we're at a good place of the design of that that has that's probably we still want to we still intend to do it. We've secured the right way. We have the land. And I think that's going to be necessary for our build out but we've kind of not shifted our priority but we've made more of a spotlight on on doing the improvements to the southern east west connector of improvements Jim and Agriab and then also working on improvements of highway 92 to incorporate churn lanes as Pam said and keeping our fingers crossed that will be successful with the grand opening in June which funds much greater improvements for on east Milton from around South St. Blaze to feel crest. Any questions about any of the infrastructure projects? All right. Thank you Pam. Tim unfortunately wasn't feeling well and had to leave but council has reports in your packet if you have any questions I'm happy to follow up with him or you may do so yourself. Anything from my team Paley? Okay.
