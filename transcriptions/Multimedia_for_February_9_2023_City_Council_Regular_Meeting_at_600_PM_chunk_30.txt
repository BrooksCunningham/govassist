movable property you guys have an introduce all right thank you councilman we're married second second by Mr. Stansbury and council comments or questions yeah can we pull up the map of this I should have brought this up to you earlier I was catching flights so I wasn't able to talk to you about it question catch catching flights that's the only flight I'm sorry yeah yeah uh it's going to be Minota and uh cedar groves yeah man your way off your upon uh fortune and bone-in caram off guard yeah cedar hills uh can you zoom in on the uh tree line where Minota dead is going up oh no no or yeah zoom in on that okay so there's a swell right there right there so I'm assuming no road can be put right because that was the intent of this was no road we'll be able to be extended out to 92 yeah it's it's still going to say a ban is what I'm saying because there's a swell there well even even if it's so even if it's a uh even we don't have any desire to build a road there absolutely you know and you would certainly have to go along with that you know but if if the property owner decided decides to put a road there we would have to permit a culvert crossing at that ditch I don't know am I am I right Clint I mean yeah if they needed a driveway access we have to we have to permit that because it's a culvert that could potentially be the an obstruction of drainage so um I'm just curious what yeah and wait can chime in wait and uh no problem this all came about um with the adjacent property armistonepper evidently he had checked in with the assessor's office and the assessor had assessed the adjacent property owners which with each 50% of the property Mr. Nepper contends that he owns the entirety of the area that is abandoned and I misgidry and I met with the neppers advised them that we had no control over the assessor's office but would look into it further and that we're not here to uh establish a boundary misgidry was successful in talking to some of the administration at the assessor's office and basically what we understood was when there is an abandoned right-of-way in conference on the property it has been the practice of the assessor's office to equally assess the adjacent land on they also don't get in the business of establishing boundaries so our recommendation to the neppers was go visit with Mr. Como bring what evidence you have investible up to you the section of the ordinance that's being asked to be repealed is a limitation on the removable property whoever owns the property there was some signage issues I believe adopted in that ordinance which I don't think was correct so while we were reviewing Mr.
