yeah so yeah so if you don't mind what I like to say is you know I'm born and raised here I live don't fortune ruled my parents still own yours to go take care right there so my grandparents when here I get it I give what you'll say but we had another option that we were looking at was potentially doing three town homes right there we were trying to stay away from the town homes you know just to kind of give that small town feel but but that is another option where you just having a shared wall right which would meet most of y'all variants and that's all needed so I don't know if that's something that we need to re-represent if this is not viable for all or thank you town homes we throw you into a whole different part of the regulation of the ordinance of our or a development ordinances so I think before we would even be able to determine that's for not tonight yeah we would have to see what type of plan you have and if you meet all our restrictions according to the town home ordinance yeah yeah no that's fair yeah I would say that two homes on that property wouldn't financially make sense yeah for us so just just because you know purchase price versus renovation costs and doing all that it wouldn't it would it would put the price per house just not economically so hey I can appreciate that I understand I think and I'm gonna go back to what I said earlier and add to it it's to trickle down effect or the domino effect sure I'm highly concerned at the value that the properties are probably selling for quite lower than normal and what's gonna be coming in to develop and over develop right the area where it downtown can that area cannot handle 10 more lots like this that which are proposing so approving something like this in the area between current existing homes multiple homes doesn't make sense you know we we did approve something a little bit different cottage type but it was on the corner near the park we also had McClellan's who both property was an open vacant lot there was nothing else around it you know they had street to street so I think there are some unique opportunities but when it comes between homes for me it's you know we have to be gatekeepers says the Marissa earlier we appreciate that yeah have you and other sister I guess really early with us because we've only you know exchanged you know communication by email but have you had an opportunity to look at that town at home ordinance and really see the requirements of it a little bit or not thoroughly yeah we've done it in life but we haven't looked at the yeah we yeah we probably would like to more time to be
