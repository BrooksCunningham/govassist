best practices that there would strengthen our application on that so uh pam's team is making the modifications we look forward to resubmitting that project uh the good news is that was really a design while the designs complete same as guillibus shimmettory that's really looking at our 2022 transportation plan for like our build out population growth similar to guillibus and east milton uh sorry similar to guillibus shimmettory we do think that there's potentially some interim improvements that we'll be able to do on that east milton corridor uh turning lanes as an example at least probably one uh ideally two will really help you know move traffic you know along there a little bit better until we get the entire project uh we until we can get the entire project uh awarded so we're going to continue to work on the big project and do some uh move towards doing some interim solutions in the meantime uh but on a positive note we did get uh we did get awarded for another one that we've been years in the making and that was at the four-way stop sign at south of rivier and uh north and south of rivier and uh 92 uh Matt said it best to me earlier this week i mean that was something that we did years ago i mean that used to be a very dangerous intersection uh it's a dott intersection it's not owned by the city of youngsville and it's even more complicated because it one of the quadrances the city limits are brusard uh but we tackled it with grant applications years ago uh dott decided to make it a safer intersection by doing the flashing light which actually it it did help but this week right about five o'clock or maybe it was last week i'm kind of confused on the days right now but uh i was probably 20 cars deep at that intersection so um we didn't lose sight of just still trying to do an improvement there we applied for a grant i think in may and we were just selected so very excited about that um and what's really exciting about it is that it was a it was a grant application that's being paid for by the private developer the BO group that owns the large empty track of property uh on that intersection so we were the lead applicant because we control well we don't control the intersection but our city limits kind of control the i guess geometry of it uh but it was cooperative with the city of brusard and the BO group so i want to publicly thank them uh the timing on that design is going to work uh he's going to coincide with the construction of Pam's project that she was talking about earlier so we really do what we have a myriad of things in design we really do try to put thought into not having
