across all utility departments and anticipated house count growth and implementation of utility capital development fees. And then we go into elaborate during fiscal year 24 the city added $675 new water customers, $480 new sewer customers, $500 new garbage customers. And then for fiscal year 25 the budgeted year reflects a projected increase of 5.2% in new utility customers. So if you want to say here that what we're talking about here is all house customers is over say. And so, excuse me if there's no questions on the budget message I was going to go into utility fund, which is on page 28. And we'll go through each department. There's a tremendous amount of information in each department and then we'll complete by looking at the entire utility fund on page 26. But let's go to page 28. As I said, there's a lot of detail here. I am not intending to go over all this detail. If you all have a question, let's stop and talk about it. I'm going to hit the total for 23, which is your four left column. And then I'm going to look at moving to the right side of the page, the 24 estimated totals compared to the 25 budget year estimated totals. So I'm going to really hit those three columns. I'm not going to deal too much with the 24 original budget or the estimating columns toward the middle of the page. That doesn't need trouble. Just let me know.

And this is an actual audit the number from last year, 3.8 million is where we came in when you add in these different sources of revenues for the water department. For fiscal year 24, the other way we're in now, we're expecting revenues to increase to a little over four million dollars, about a quarter million dollar increased year over year. You can see those different sources and where they're increasing. And then for fiscal year 25, increasing to almost 4.5 million, a shade under that. a healthy increase of over 400,000 from fiscal year 24. So revenues steadily increasing and as was elaborated in the budget message from 24 to 25 at least, this is based on new customers. That's what I want to say about here for the revenues. There's the expenses that begin on page 28 and then continue on the top of page 28 where we get to the totals. So again, I'm not going to go through the detail of all these sections. But in total for expenditures in 2023, 3.3 million. And then that number increases almost $700,000 in the current year to a shade of over $4 million, $4 million 32 to be exact. And then about $215,000 increase to the 25 year for $4 million 247. The good news is operating incomes all three years. And that's what you want to see. In 2023, operating income at $335,000, we do take
