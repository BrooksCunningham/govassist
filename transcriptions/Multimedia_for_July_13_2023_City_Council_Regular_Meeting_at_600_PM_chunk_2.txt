Any council discussion? Yes, ma'am. Hi, I'm Ms. Nguyen Van Gau. Mayor, council. So in 2.2, so it was 3% cost of living raise for everyone, excluding chief Rikibudro. So I would like clarity of why he was excluded from the 3% cost of living raise. Currently there is a lawsuit pending by his attorney himself. Please, please. Please don't look at me like I'm crazy. No, no, no, no, it's important to make sure I'm getting my thoughts here. Also, we have some other items are our attorney and the attorneys that we hired are looking into as well as close to $25,000 that has been expensed by the chief that we have not come to an arrangement yet. Okay. So he's being excluded the 3% until you'll find your findings or whatever is what you're saying.
