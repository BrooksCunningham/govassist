Nepper's request we came across the section five which in my opinion was not correct and so you're being asked only to repeal that section that limited the use of that a movable property regardless if you want it did I answer your question are there any other questions I'm sorry no I just worry about what's going to go there what's going to happen there uh you know he owns the iites business right there to the left um if you already call he dropped a covert there without permission then got the permission and there's concrete bags uh that held up that and now it has since two years later it's been repaid a little bit redone uh if you take i know dawns looked at it a couple times coto force one officer uh the stores that he owns back down manolta he has it abandoned boat in the tree line it's been there for four years um and a couple other things it's just appearances you know you look at it from citywide we try to keep things looking nice and everything uh i think the intent at the time when we our council decided to do the sign only on there was i think his intent was to have advertisement for his storage business and that's why we i think i don't know like that i do think that's where it originated probably some of i i mean they were back to when uh you know Simone was was serving as chief administrative officer i think i think the i think the initial issue there that is our recall uh was uh wanting to advertise for the self-storage facility and uh in signage on on east milton um it didn't qualify for a sign there because it was considered an off-premise sign it wasn't on the same premise uh that was my i think that's what started the conversation i think probably had the had the administration at the time permitted a sign for that i mean but it wasn't it wasn't his property to permit and because of the part so i think it was the right judgment call at the time to deny the request for the permit because i agreed with the assessment that it would have been considered an off-premise sign i do think that's what kind of started the conversation at that time i guess my ass would just be to make sure if something's coming on the property that you know that it'd be maybe brought to the council for consideration i feel like everything's happened around my name sir please would you i'm sorry i hate to leave my coming up please i might need to move now i'm just going to mention the fact that there is the transmission line that run right there there is a right a way that will not allow certain things to be built within some of the fee to be sought
