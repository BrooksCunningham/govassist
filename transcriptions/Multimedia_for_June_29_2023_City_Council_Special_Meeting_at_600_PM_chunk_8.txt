other three on shift at all ever we have the traffic sergeant right now the traffic officer they come in they stagger the hours one comes in at seven in the morning and then the other guy comes in at nothing nine so that what we got covers during the morning school traffic and school traffic exactly now that school is out they both come in at eight and work they eight to five okay so they're essentially on a I guess a day shift yes okay there are any other questions council ma'am yes ma'am deputy chief this org chart only shows one officer open those where the other officers because you said we haven't filled some you haven't filled some of them yes great so what are they I don't want you to say their names but which ones don't we have that's all that's showing on our org chart because we're not showing three openings right and that I see right but again those were budgeted last year we requested the additional officers and the council gave us three we just hadn't had opportunity to fill those positions as I say in the process we also lost people so that's where some of x is you're not seeing them because they just they were here but they're no longer here so our our current budget is budgeted for four officers per shift yes which we're not reflecting this isn't reflecting three from my issue that's correct I'd I'm more comfortable going back to the one that we started with honestly because I was I was I mean every between Kristen Kristen's under the impression that there's three open positions that are ready to be filled yes yes that is correct okay all right and that's that's really what you were looking at before so I think plus the one yeah so I think the only part of the this was part of the issue that's why we're going to be meeting yeah yeah this and some other things we just need to get on the same page before we do any so so in the in the higher process of the three we approved we ended up losing three and you transferred three into those positions and left the three still open so you never filled them begin with that's why I still think so you need to fill that the the SRO position the CID position and then the officer on b shift plus the three that you still currently had ever filled yes so essentially being two after that I'm I'll let's talk if you yeah that's no I'm I'm understand I went back to the old one yeah this one I don't have the old one it was this one and it shows the CID SRO officer at the top left as need to be filled it showed shift B officer need to be filled but that's but that's not correct it needs to
