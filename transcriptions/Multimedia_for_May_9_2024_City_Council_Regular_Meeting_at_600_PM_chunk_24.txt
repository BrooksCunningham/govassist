2024 in ordinance amending ordinance 357.1 2013 performance land use regulations within the city limits of the city of young zoole Louisiana the objective here council for the public i mean we use a land use system you saw it you saw kind of an interpret you know our interpretation of that chart by evaluating the proposed business earlier next to another business what we're proposing to do on this you'll see it outlined in the text of the ordinance we're asking to reclassify several streets into another category other major collector or major arterial so that would trigger a another grid to determine the conflict conflict level but i would encourage you to maybe go through it you know this is only for introduction if you have any other feedback on it we can make modifications on it up to the time of adoption the goal of this is really just to try to reserve as much property as we can for potential commercial development that and also to you know really just have our best foot forward for developers to see where do we want to encourage development where do we want to be more restrictive less restrictive so we're we're proposing several changes to it but it can certainly be amended you know to your pleasure so we're also working on a project to where that map will be updated with the GIS layer so in doing that what we would do is have it as a GIS layer on our website to where you'd be able to tell you know put if you put that layer on to like an overlay onto our map you'd be able to see what district of subject properties in and then in the future if we as we annex properties you know we're going to make it a more concerted effort to designate that property that properties land use at the time of annexation consideration.
