with regards to still wanting to have a recycling program I mean you can look around you know this is it's a new conversation for well it's our it's our conversation tonight but I can say that other government agencies are asking the same questions of their residents and of themselves about the to the extent that you want to provide a recycling service so that's something you know and that's why you're seeing other you know governments mean when at contract renewal you can look at options like eliminating that type of program you can look at drop-off programs and there's different there's different you know I'm sure they'll have I'm sure they'll have options to present and consider but keep it in mind that's likely going to be just more volume that would be picked up you know in trash cans if it if that was discontinued well then that's not my concern was I remember last year you know you and your staff and team that are really good job of trying to advocate on how to properly recycle because we were paying a pretty substantial increase in the difference because they were not recycling properly so I guess I'm just thinking about it logically I don't want to speak for obviously all residents but I can I can test that I see quite a bit of cans that are just filled with you know I'm trash and debris and recycling cans that aren't supposed to be in there so I know we're absorbing that cost and that's where the loss is I mean I don't I don't mind you know taking a little bit of a loss in in garbage but are maintaining is where about to be but if we're if we have to increase the cost at the risk of you know increasing the utility bills just so that we can absorb a greater loss later on recycling I don't know if it's going to be worth it I don't know if we that's something with the poll or something we've got more information on but I don't know I guess looking at it on a on a two to three year basis every time we review this it's we're taking a pretty substantial loss continuously on recycling and into and so waste so if we increase that it'll add us to know where that loss is going to be just something to think about Mr. Mayor I won't make a motion but my right and I know we can amend this when it gets presented for final introduction at the next meeting before I made the motion though just everybody's on the same page there's two adjustments on here and first one being the solid the base rate for solid waste item three going from 23 to 27 which is only a four dollar increase which is something that we talked about years ago about trying not to go up too too much
