think this is the three percent tax that we got a three mill tax five hundred and thirty six thousand five hundred and eighty eight thousand for the for this current year and six hundred and forty three thousand for next year we have slight amounts on insurance proceeds interest income gain on sale of assets and an interest expense which is on the bonded debt here this is on the utility debt eighty five thousand on utility debt last year this year sixty two back up to eighty two thousand next year so total non operating revenues or expense it's it's a net revenue because of that that three-million tax four hundred and sixty one thousand this year because we have a grant a federal grant for the sports complex of a million it's a million five eighty three and for next year it's three million sixty thousand dollars income before contributions and transfers course transfers are going to balance off as you can see but you can have other items from bonded debt last year and so on so the total that's coming in from other financing sources last year because we had twenty three million dollars that was issued in bonds is twenty four million five hundred and sixty one thousand in total that includes the premium that we got on the issuance of the debt and so on and so forth this year it's anticipated to only be two thousand seven hundred eight dollars remember I said the transfers to and from funds it it should balance and it does and in next year it's a net of about eight million dollars and this is proceeds from the bonds and from the debt again I think this debt is going to be the DEQ and the the federal debt at point nine five percent okay bottom line net excess of deficiency of revenues last year we showed a huge surplus of eighteen point nine million but a lot of that because we issued debt and that's just the way we we have to show it but I'm going to get to a certain point that I'm going to show you what your operational surplus is for each year we're going to take this into consideration so this year we're anticipated right at an eleven million dollar deficit and next year the deficit is estimated at seven million eight hundred and fifty thousand so these are huge numbers huge swings one way or the other so what I like to do now is to take these well let me ask you say any comments or any any questions that somebody may have okay if not I'd given it did you hand those out you did good that was that that was a separate handout and it's called it's titled operating surplus summary it's going to have different columns it's going to begin with the year eighteen nineteen twenty all actual numbers per the audit okay everybody see
