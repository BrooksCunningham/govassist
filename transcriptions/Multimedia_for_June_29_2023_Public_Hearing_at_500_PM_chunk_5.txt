we had revenues of 1.481 expenditures, actually exceeded it, 1.6 million, and we had a slight loss. In 23, we fixed that, you have expenditures of 1.8 million with revenues of 1.8 million, and a slight profit. And that's basically what you want to do in your sanitation department, it's basically cover costs, which you guys are doing. And in 24th, it's very similar to 2023, 1.9 million of revenues, 1.9 million of cost, and about $22,000, $23,000 of net income. That covers each individual department. If we flip two pages back to page 19, it's a little easier to see, and we can combine everything together and see how the utility funds are doing as a whole. And looking at the revenues for 2022 coming in, it's 7 million, 3.81, adding everything all together, I held the increase in the current year to a little over $9 million of revenues, and then about a 9.8% increase from 23 to 24 to 9.9 million in revenues for the budget year. Expenditures in 2022 came in at right at 6.9 million and generated a profit of $514,000. For this year, we expect expenditures to increase to about $7.6 million, and generate a profit of $1.4 million. And for the budget year, expenditures do go up by 10.7% to $8.4 million, and we still generate a profit of about a million five, we'll call it a little bit more than last year. So, I mean, overall, taking a look at here from operations, very healthy every year, covering expenditures from the revenue standpoint. This is what you want to see. Any questions on 19? If you flip the page 20, you actually do have a property tax bringing in roughly a half-million dollars, a very first line item each year. I mean, you do also have some interest expense, so not operating revenues or expenditures in its revenues, in this case net, 412,000 in 22, 420 in the current year, up to 433 for the budget year. So, you can see income after the property tax and the operations we just spoke about, a profit of 925,000 in 22, up to a million eight in the current year we're expecting, and for the budget year, a million nine. Any questions on pages 19, 20, or 21? All right, moving right along, let's move on to the park. That's going to be on page 22. And page 22 will handle similar to the utility fund, looking at the revenues for 22, came in at a million three actual number. For the current year, we expect revenues to increase to a million 457. When I kind of scanned it, taking a look at it, concession fees, kind of the big driver for the current year of increase, you can see toward the middle of the section, 146 in 22, up to 241. So, about a hundred thousand dollar increase in the concession is driving that revenue number up in the current year to a
