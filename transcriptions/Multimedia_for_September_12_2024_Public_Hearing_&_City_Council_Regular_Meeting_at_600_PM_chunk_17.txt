have another have two meetings scheduled with them so i want to meet next week and talk about the patch and overlay now that we're through with larivier to start talking about that which is your right sizing funds and then we have been looking at some modifications for the tractor roundabout shimmy agriab people have probably seen us we've been out there looking at um school traffic and trying to see what we can do to improve some of our congested areas and so we're working with the mayor on some of the things that we're finding that we could do whether it be some left turn lanes some um in certain areas so we've been uh closely working on those items and then um it won't be long we'll be working with Nicole and the mayor on the capital outlay to make sure that uh highway 99 highway 89 continues to get funding as well as for and also are other projects that we have so excuse i just want to emphasize a couple things that you said one is relative to the tractor round about them and as you know in the 2024 project that's the full depth patching and resurfacing of that roundabout uh in its current geometry uh it's just to address the base failures that are there that's why Pam said that that's tentatively scheduled for October 14th to 16th we had planned that once ago to coincide with fall break uh the reason why that's important is because that intersection will need to be temporarily closed while we do that so we're trying to pick an optimal time to rebuild that roundabout um with perfect weather it shouldn't take longer hopefully then the weekend plus the days that the um the days that schools out on break valesco crossing will be open at that time the uh overlay that that Pam's mentioned using the right size credit is going to be using our credits from right sizing highway 89 to do a patch mill and overlay of highway 92 which is iberius street from the clock roundabout uh to bonan and then the curve around bonan becomes e smilting all the way to veraught so we have about three million dollars in dottd credits and roughly it's about a million dollars for a mile of a patch mill and overlay today's pricing so it's going to hopefully fit perfectly we think that it we've now been around the entire city with dottd at least twice and then once backwards to try to figure out where we can redeem these credits and we feel like that's probably a good spot to use them uh because eventually that road is going to need a resurfacing work um the uh someone's asked me recently about the track to round about it while it is true we did design that intersection with a double lane roundabout that was really part of our buildout plan from our transportation
