you thought sports complex budgeted 5.3 million spent 5.4 million about 85 thousand more than we thought last year was 4.5 million in that particular category we just talked about why it increased debt service principal retirement was budgeted at 4 million 148 and we actually spent 3 million 607 on debt retirement for principle 500 thousand less than we thought interest payment to the fiscal agent and the bond issuance 1 million 555 was budgeted we actually spent a million 601 that's 45 thousand dollars more than we thought last year was a million 3.44 obviously we've issued some debt so our interest cost have gone up over the prior year a capital outlay was a significant item here 14 million 8.48 is what was budgeted we actually spent 16 million 8.24 a million 9.76 over budget again the budget is based upon where we think we are or where we are let's say for 10 months or 9 months with the projects and then you have to forecast how much is going to be needed or spent in the next 3 months and it's kind of difficult because you don't know exactly where all of these projects are but the funds were approved on this understand because you approved the projects they were bid in whatever cases but the spending is what you're budgeting here on an annual basis so 1 million 9.76 more than what was anticipated when the budget was amended total expenditures for the city you budgeted to spend 44 million 577 thousand we actually spent 46 million 144 thousand that's a million 5 more than we thought primarily mainly in a capital outlay area because some of the others were up and down in various cases but that being said remember the 5% variance and the variance came in right at the bottom of the page I've indicated it it came in at 3.86% off a budget so you're again within the tolerance level even though the numbers seem large they are but they're within tolerance excess of deficiency back towards the middle of the page you had anticipated an excess or deficiency in this case that you were going to spend more primarily because the capital of 2.7 million dollars more than we thought we came in at 6 million 68 thousand more than we thought that's 3.3 million dollars difference from where we were anticipating at this line item now other financing sources as you know with the government when you issue debt it shows as like another financing source like a revenue source 23 million was budgeted 23 million 590 and proceeds from issuance of bonds it came in at 23 million 786 thousand dollars a hundred and ninety five thousand over budget gain on sale of assets you had budgeted nothing came in at a hundred and fifty four thousand on sale of some surplus properties and also proceeds from the capital lease 620 thousand again that's the issuance of
