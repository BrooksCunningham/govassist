payment on the fire truck of 257. It was mentioned in the budget message. Then in the 9081, I'm sorry, sales tax fund for police, you have three replacement units, five new patrol units, and one vehicle for the chief, $338,458. Again, to be paid for from the 1981 sales tax. The axon enterprises is the other thing, 269,0897. Total for the sales tax fund or for the police is $608,000. That's included in this budget. Items nine through 22. And there's a lot of items here. This is the biggest item, our biggest section, which is in street capital projects. You have a total of $42 million, as you can see. Some of the bigger items are the highway 89 improvements. And it shows you, you're getting quite a bit of state capital outlay funds here, about 8.9 million and a city through its sales tax or the bond issue is going to put up 2.2 million to do the project. Another big item, number 12, is the fortune road extension, 5.5 million state capital outlay monies, 25% match from the city. Highway 92, again, a big item, a million, 380,000. Then on item 15, highway 92, Prescott, roundabout, $3 million. Again, a lot of monies from the LDOTD state capital outlay. Next item is number 19. It's a regional drainage detention pond project for $8.5 million funded from the federal grant. So again, the 43 million, and again, there's any specific questions on any of these. Certainly, we would try and answer or have, or try and answer those questions. On page six, the utility fund, quite a few items here. Items 23 through 33. You can see is water and sewer, and of course, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38, some trucks and whatever in here as well. But some of the big items, item 23 is $2.7 million for water utility treatment plant. Again, the revolving loan, the water sector grant is going to pay for this. The elevated tank, 2.1 million, again, that's the revolving loan slash grant, LDH. Big item is the wastewater, sewer plant, treatment plant improvements, $5.3 million. Again, DEQ revolving loan and in state capital outlay monies. Total for the utility fund is $15 million, $15 million, $35,000. For those young sports complex, which we talked about earlier, you have quite a few movable items, and then, of course, the big item is the expansion of the park. And that's going to be paid for from the bonds that we mentioned, plus I think we got a million dollars from the state on this. But a total to be spent for the park at $15.9 million. Total capital outlay, as I said, in the budget message, $74.3 million. I just kind of added it up of what I see as grants, but probably about $36 million of this $74 million is paid for from grants. So the city has to fund the balance of about $38 million, and you're funding that
