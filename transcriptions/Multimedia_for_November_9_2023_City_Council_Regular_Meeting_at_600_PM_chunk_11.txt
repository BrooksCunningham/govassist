one side, uh, and then on the park side, uh, we put a bigger buffer there. Okay. Ten, uh, ten in the front and then five in the back. Is that correct? Okay. So we're asking for ten less than the front and five less than the back. If I'm correct on the ordinances, that right? Let me look at it. So he's what he, what's illustrated on our papers five for rear. Let's see. Five. Technically five and five. Typically. Yeah. But he's asking for five less here. Well, the way, the way, the way, the way your ordinance is written today is that it's 20 and all the landings, the ambient landings. So just let me, let me, let me just maybe draw a parallel where, where else we have an increased setback. So there's several places where setbacks are reference one would be setbacks are, uh, you know, traditional, oh no, excuse me, I was going to say a traditional neighborhood to valve. Traditional neighborhood development is less, but a normal copperfield neighborhood. It's, it's, uh, ten in the rear, 20 in the front, five on the sides. You know, T and D's, you know, it's a little bit more dense. We, we, you know, factor that into, you know, drainage assumptions, things like that. Uh, mobile homes on a single parcel, you have 30 foot setback in all directions. Um, and, uh, land use ordinances, you know, there's, there's varied setbacks dependent upon how obnoxious, you know, the use it is. The goal here again was basically to, if you were to, if you were to remove the requirement of you have to come and get it your low density development approved, if it's hypothetically, if that was removed, there's a lot of stuff you could do here with those setbacks. So what you said is, you know what, let's tighten it up or let's, let's tighten up your usable space to basically have to have this conversation to say, you know, what are you planning there? And how do I see it being used? There was really no implication on the 2020, 2020 with regards to drainage or anything like that. It was really just more of like an aesthetic and, uh, preference thing. Pam and all right. I mean, Oh, yeah, that's okay. You are correct. The engineer just has to make sure that absolutely nothing drains away. You only have five feet, so everything's going to have to drain enter and you're going to have to make sure that, um, I would request that if they do that, whenever they give whatever documents he has for it, that he's got to have it in his HOA documents to make sure that the HOA of that development recognizes that all drainage has to come to the center so that there is absolutely nothing running off on that five feet adjacent properties because people will tend, if they're, if they own it to start doing
