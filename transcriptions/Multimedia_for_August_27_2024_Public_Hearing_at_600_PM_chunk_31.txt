put up for me. Plain and simple, I level, don't block drive. They do it anyway, ladies and gentlemen. I put my garbage can there, I look like an idiot, but if I don't, they use, they, the parents will turn, they're coming from middle school. They are in the wrong direction, they have to turn around to face the middle school to pick up their child. They will use my driveway to turn around in and not blink an eye, and sometimes I'm right there watching. And I'll lovingly go ask them, maybe not always lovingly, because it frustrates me, I can't understand why you using my driveway to turn around in. And I lovingly ask them and they roll their eyes and tell me I'm rude. It's illegal to use my driveway, okay? Why can't you get that? They say it should be illegal. But they don't care. I think that's it. They basically don't care. And secondly, I've asked for a speed limit sign. There was one there, Mr. Ritter, there was one there that on fourth in Avenue B, there was one there that was removed. Why was it not put back? I've asked, please put one there so people would know where the speed limit is there. I was told there's one at the end of fourth street, ma'am. That's sufficient. On Highway 89 and four, there's one there, I was told. Today is there one, it doesn't matter. I would like one on Avenue B and fourth. Mr. Ritter, they're starting to pick up speed on fourth street. I'm seeing it. School traffic, right? Well, also the residents, well, do respect also from the residents in Fair Haven, this Grantee Landon, the teachers. I guess my point is there's so much traffic in that area and I find it's unfair to those that live on fourth street, ladies and gentlemen. Will you always have this route for school? Well, unfortunately, not unfortunately, let me say this, Green Tea Landon's been there since the 50s, 60s, 50s, I think, right? That's a whole other dialogue as to why the school was expanded there. You recall there was portable buildings out to the front of the road. So public meetings such as this previously, people were concerned about where were the kids going to go to school, enough portable building so the school was expanded. You know, I'm working with what we can. You know what we can do? What we did do. Foster Park Road, remember, Foster Park Road was, it was being returned to the earth. It was so poorly kept up when the parish did it. Now you can go back there and at least queue cars for going to Green Tea Landon. I don't know that I can never solve that problem with all due respect. I don't, and it, not because I don't want to, not because I don't want to. I don't, I don't, gives me no pleasure when you
