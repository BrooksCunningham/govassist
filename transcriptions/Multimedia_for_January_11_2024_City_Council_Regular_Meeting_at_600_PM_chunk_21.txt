conversation at next audit report unless we make an adjustment there one thing I also just want to share with you and mention is and this is just again my mythology to present you you know information to where you can make an you know informed decisions currently as you know a public worksmanage is a branch to brief pick up you know several months of the year it's once a month several months of the year it's twice a month it's pretty established program that our residents are accustomed to that expense is probably about nine eight or nine thousand dollars when we just look at the landfill cost alone that's not your market any of the you know public works labor you know or you know the transport costs or anything like that that's just the the charges from the landfill is about nine thousand a month those expenses are not being captured within the sanitation department today so I'm pointing that out there too so that way you can just know the little bit when you look at the the profit and loss statement for sanitation it's pretty cut and dry just know that it's absent the landfill expenses or any you know true accounting of the actual expenses associated with that service that's being provided the other thing I just wanted to share with you I mean I know no one likes you know pay more I know I certainly don't but one thing that I wanted to just share with you and I put it I put it on your place I copied a news article that was from the Acadian advocate Lafayette Consolidated Government did an RFP recently for a garbage contractors that RFP resulted five five proposals the the one that was selected just started November 1st it's been pretty you know documented in the news and that service was curbside recycling and curbside you know trash pick up similar to what we are accustomed to here and that that bid that the LCG accepted for the city of Lafayette it's thirty dollars and thirty two cents so I'm I'm painting that picture for you today you're at twenty three I'm not of the opinion that we go up to thirty dollars and thirty two cents I think that's a pretty that's a that's a large increase even though I'm telling you the reality is waste management just went up fourteen point eight percent with one letter to us so what's what's in the draft ordinance for you for your consideration as a result of the audit report and the the noted you know the notation there really you can you can adjust the the dollar amount as you see fit I think right now right now in the ordinance for introduction it's just twenty seven dollars happy to answer any questions about it or give you any information that you need there yes sir mr.
