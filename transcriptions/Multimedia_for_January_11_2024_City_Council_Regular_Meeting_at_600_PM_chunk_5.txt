it could be cash generated or not within the water department. And you can see we're generating cash over approximately $8 in 2023. Last year was almost 10, before that 11 and back in $20, almost $16. So from a cash perspective, we're about half where we were in 2020. Doing the same kind of approach with sewer, you have less sewer customers, but you do have a similar percentage increase in the number of customers. And you can see that the income, similar to what we saw with water, not much change over the four years. 36 and change back in 20, we had about $35 we're calling it in the current year. Expenditures ranging from $23 back in 20, they're about $30 in 2021 and 22, we're almost at 28 this year. And about $7 of operating income in the current year, which has kind of been the middle of where the past four years have been within add back depreciation. And you can see we're generating cash in the sewer department of $18 roughly. That's a little hard to last year when it was 16 and even harder than it was in 21 when it was only 13. Bottom left is garbage. You can see the income is about $22 in 20 and 21. Then it dips about $20 in change in 20, I'm sorry, in 22 and 23. But that cost is steadily increasing every year, which we kind of talked about earlier. And so you can see that operating income or loss in the bottom line, we can skip it because we don't have any depreciations to go to cash. You lost $2.55 of cash in the garbage department this year. Last year is about $2, where in 21 you generated $2.10. I'd like to see you get back to somewhere around that 2021 number in an ideal situation. To me, that would be ideal. And then moving to the bottom right is going to be bringing everything all together. And you can see how steady the revenues are, ranging between about $105 and $102, coming in at $102 in change in the current year. And look at all consisting the operating expenditures are between 21 and 23. Roughly 94 to 96 over that three year period. It's really difficult to do in a utility fund because some of the expenditures are so high. But over this three year period, the expenditures are very much under control. You have operating income for all three years, adding back roughly $16 of depreciation over the three or four years, and generating cash of $23 this year, which compares extremely similar to last year with $23 in change as well, which makes sense with my comments in the order report that the income was almost identical. So you would expect that bottom line to be very similar. So overall, very healthy. I mean, it's not quite where it was in 20 where you can see we're generating $42,
