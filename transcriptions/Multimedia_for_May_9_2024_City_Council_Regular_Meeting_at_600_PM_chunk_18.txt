where the values at in the city it's not in the parish so yeah and uh council this conversation probably started easily 60 days ago i wanted to wait until uh until tonight to bring it forward to you some of us may have had you know individual conversations about it the objective from for me in getting a level of comfort to bring it to you this evening was really twofold um what threefold you could say one ensuring that we have adequate water pressure because as you saw we're we're getting infrastructure costs that are exceeding our budget and exceeding our expectations um and that are also contingent upon future improvements happening uh the water plant does in fact are in you know the the storage tank the elevated storage tank at 440 dates on which is roughly between like oak shadows and wells landing on the bayou park produce side um you know we've done a lot of had a lot of conversations with Susan who runs our water model about how long can we wait before building it and so forth but we're at a level of comfort that we do have adequate water pressure there if we don't do the elevated storage tank today um or in the you know the imminent future so it's uh i might a level of comfort to present anything to you to tell you that water pressure will be adequate um because we are moving forward we will be moving forward with the new plant um secondly is fire protection you know we certainly don't want to while we appreciate Mrs. James's contribution uh we don't want to have a secondary issue of inadequate water pressure in the event of an emergency um Mr. Chamsy is a civil engineer as well so um he had some creative solutions in the water modeling like you said to up size you know uh water main sizes and things like that to help deliver the the you know the desired gallons per minute that was requested by a chief revet and then finally you know as you know um Shem and Agriab is part of our road improvement project series uh that we have um under planning today um i do have a i do have a new outlay for it in my office i welcome any of y'all to come visit and i can show it to you um we do have p5 money for capital outlay um if that p5 capital outlay is advanced the way it is today um our 25% match on just that p5 was uh going to be near two million dollars um and it's a kind of a deplorable you know road today to be adding more traffic to it uh so that's why in conversations with the developer um you know we talked about a betterment for the road for road necessary road improvements that would be used for Shem and Agriab so i
