I know DAX was there to representing fence to make or but what councilman Barra spoke on behalf of the city for was really we have $3 million of road transfer credits that we accepted to take ownership of Youngso highway initially so to state road we had a lot of different grant funding source opportunities of the one that seemed to be the most viable path was capital outlay dollars so that's the path we went in order to get ownership of it so we could move forward with it we accepted road transfer credits those are in essence you know the way I describe them just to myself or it's monopoly money because you still have a lot of limitations but how and where you can use them so as Pam's going through the litany of other projects you know as you know we've been designing the tracked around about for improvements to veterans around about for improvements long-lane road extension all these things we're trying to plug in the various funding sources because sales tax and sales tax bonds and cash on loan aren't going to get us there I'm reminded that we have three million dollars of road transfer credits and the only reason we're doing the capital outlay project on Youngso highway because we're fixing a former state road so now with a new administration new transportation secretary our ask I believe is a simple one and that is hey we have a C-more project we have a contractor that's mobilized we have we have phase I'm sorry priority one money that's made it through the bond commission we know what our total dollar amount is we have the match we're waiting on concurrence of the contract so everything stepped in place and what we're asking our legislative delegation the new secretary and the new administration is can we unlock at least part of those three million dollars in road transfer credits so it's what I call monopoly credits can we unlock part if not all of them to cash to where we can apply that to continue on our next phase of Youngso highway which would be from fortune road stable palm south to the intersection where we are today the challenge has been we've tried to play the textbook game of use those road transfer credits on eligible roads the issue in Youngsoville is there's really not eligible roads in which to use them yes we could use them on Youngso highway but Youngso highway would have required the Department of Transportation to have been part of the design but we've already now have it designed so there's some there's some levels of bureaucracy to go through there but we believe that it's the best use of taxpayer dollars whether it's the state or our local taxpayer dollars to can we work out a settlement if you will on these road transfer credits because we have a contractor that can continue if nothing
