and strength weakness assessment where do we have opportunities and how can we best complement each other and very similar to as was the case with Miss Andrews promotion I realized that the best answer was right already within my team I'm proud to present to you my nominee for chief operating officer and I'll talk about that in a second but it's Terry Bork and Terry as many of you know his earned was our hired as our public works director in 2016 he's earned my trust during that time over the past seven years of working together immediately after the 2016 flood Simone and our then administration decided that we really had to revamp our maintenance department at the time because no disrespect to that team but wasn't quite to the level of public works that you'd expect in a growing modern city like like we have so Terry was brought on after 15 years of public works experience and a nearby parish where one of his primary jobs was the maintenance of drainage channels throughout that community since that time he's come in and created a tremendous amount of processes and policies that still benefit our citizens extremely well today it was in October of 2021 that his role expanded and we added on the title of deputy CAO at the same time that Miss Andrews was reclassified as our chief administrative officer and at that time we had a lot of projects that were pending of course we have great consultants but I needed somebody to be closer to me to advise me on a lot of the projects and opportunities Tim is excellent and is disciplined but we were having a lot of construction related pieces and moving parts happening there so Terry skillset at that time best complimented me as deputy CAO so here we are nine months after Sally's retirement and we are so fortunate and blessed to have a great administrative support team within our city hall so the role shifting a little bit I've decided to change the role to same role different title to chief operating officer because I think that's truly indicative of Terry skill set Terry has nearly 30 years of leadership experience he had an admirable six-year career in the US Army where he served at the end of a service as a E5 sergeant and as I said he's earned my trust I trust his opinion he has the respect of his team and the staff and I truly believe that he's grown our public works department into a model department not only in our own city but across our entire parish and area so anyway it's with great pleasure that I nominate Terry Bork for chief operating officer you'll still see him doing really the job that he's doing today that he enjoyed for me doing with me as deputy CAO but it's dawned on me nine months later it's no sense I have an
