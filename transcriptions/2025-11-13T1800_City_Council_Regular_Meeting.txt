 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you been this evening to be led by Pastor Chris Fusley from First Baptist Church. And then we have a special group of young ladies from Girl Scout troop 11-18 that are going to help lead us in the pledge. So, Pastor, thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Let's pray together. Father, we thank you for this day. You've given to us, Lord, we just so thankful today that there wasn't one second that we walked through this day alone. We thank you for your presence. And Father, we also give you gratitude tonight as we come together. We pray, Lord, that you'd give us vision, that you'd give us unity. And Father, give us grateful hearts, especially as we think about Thanksgiving being just a few weeks away. Today, maybe we'd be grateful for being a part of this great community. Father, God, everything that is done this evening, and we pray this in your name. Amen. Amen. Pastor, thank you for your friendship and your support of Young Svilla. So, I think we have our... All right. I want to... Oh, that's right. Oh, that's right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Legislative... ...of the United States of America, and the New York Public, for which it stands, one nation, one under God, indomitable, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. Thank you. Nicole, you want to be in the picture? I'll get one of those. Down. Oh, I know. Oh, lend a two. All right. All right. Ready? Everybody, look at me. One, two, three. Great job, girls. Well, I want everyone to know that we have such a bright future because we had a few special minutes before the meeting to visit and get to know these young ladies. They had some great questions. So, some questions that I'm very proud about. And questions to things that we're really working on. When are we going to get a Chick-fil-A? Everybody has any pull. Please help us out. We'd love one. All right. Thank you all very much. Great questions about the road construction too. Thank you all very much. Miss Gidry, please call the roll. Mr. Romero, Mr. Eileen, Michelle Vine. All right. Thank you, Nicole. The seating, we have a couple of people that are going to be addressing the council. The first, excited to welcome Pastor Joe Cormier from First Assembly Young'sville to come forward. And he's going to tell us about the great work that's happening in our community to bring us the second annual Christmas event. And we're going to be having our first event. So, Pastor, welcome, sir. Thank you so much, Mayor. I have our event coordinator here, Jessie Griffin. She knows more about it than I do. So, I just bought her maybe share a little bit of some of the details. But I just want to just make this, make it announcement that we're going to be having our Christmas event that need to be second. This is our starter, so it's an event that's just into what we can do. And second note, out of this public impact chairs, I always wanted to focus on this video. So in the last exercise, we don't have any furtherฉus that we've listened to today. And we want to focus on our gathering. world bearing gifts. It brought together in keepers and you know shepherds from the fields, people from the agricultural community, camels, gunkies, you know even some in keepers you know so you know this event that we're going to have in Young'sville does something very similar. We've we've brought together the Chamber of Commerce, local churches, our sports complex, our government officials and but I think this time in a positive way the government is involved and all around the birth of Jesus Christ and the celebration of Christmas. So again that's going to be in December 13th from 4 p.m. to 9. So I just want to take Jesse to take an opportunity maybe give a little details about some of the new things that we're doing this year. So this year we're really excited that we do have more community involvement and engagement this year which is our goal. Stellar beauty is actually stepping into to help us this year they have a huge school that they're going to be helping us with but this year our highlight presentation is our Living Bethlehem production which we used to do every year at the Sugarmill pond area and we used to have a great turnout for that and so when we were asked last year to come back and do the Living Bethlehem production at the amphitheater we're like let's do this we're going to go full force so we're bringing it back to Living Bethlehem production with camels donkeys all the animals all the live action production so that people and families can truly see and have representation of the true meaning of Christmas with some new elements that we're involving this year. We not only have the Living Bethlehem production but we have Southside High School coming with some band ensembles. Arca middle school is doing some choir different choir presentations and then years to grow daycare is doing some presentations as well and then we're going to have some Cajun reading of the night before Christmas we're going to have train rides out there with the polar express. We'll have Santa we'll have the Grinch, Whoville we're going to have a whole Bethlehem experience with a petting zoo food trucks a huge Christmas market this year that we're expanding with and we're just really excited to have the community come out and gauge and just really have a fun night under the stars together with them. Yeah so thanks so yeah excited about it thanks for the opportunity to put it on and of course we're always looking for sponsors so if anybody's interested in sponsoring this is a free event for our community and we hope to keep it that way and because you know we just want to share share this season together with our community so thank you so much and it's for minus when it is again December 13th from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Okay and I know you there's a Facebook page that's that's ready with all the information sponsorship opportunities can't thank you both enough this this type of event wouldn't be possible without first assembly so thank you all sincerely and look forward to having a great event that night. Yeah appreciate that partnership and thanks Hayley for the farmers market which is going to be with the Chamber of Commerce so yeah always awesome thank you thank you thank you. Let's see just but quickly before we move on I wanted to recognize Ms. Karen Cox Ms. Karen I'm sorry that about the the passing of your husband he was a true friend of our community and I'm grateful to see you here this evening so just in case I forget to tell you later and happy birthday to you also yes ma'am. All right. All right a gen item 3.2 I've asked let me read the gen item and then I'll explain it a little bit more McBade engineers and consultants presentation on pedestrian and parking enhancements for Sugar Mopon over the just for the council and the public's benefit recently had some dialogue with members of the Sugar Mopon community the the HOA board members councilman Shampon just the entire community about about how can other things that we can do as a community to perhaps help slow people down a little bit in Sugar Mopon in particular but I think it's a great question that that we can apply towards pretty much any part of our community so what started as a request for for something unrelated I ended up tasking Pam with looking kind of 30,000 foot viewpoint at Sugar Mopon just to see if there's any opportunity now that the neighborhood's growing a little bit further to see if there's any type of traffic calming or things like that and and really just to help educators on where four way stops may be appropriate where you know the pros and cons of speed bumps things like that so it was a good if she did a great job presenting the information to me I've taken the opportunity to where we've shared it with the the board members and now we're here to to share it with all of you so Pam I'll let you take it from there got it all right okay thank you Mayor thank you council um as you know kind of like it's just to start this out I want to explain before we get too far into it as everybody knows we always talk about Sugar Mopons the TND it is not your typical residential subdivision so resident residential subdivisions typically don't have striping don't have crosswalks but TNDs are mixed development it is not considered it is not a latrion it is not a private it is mixed so because of the fact that it has commercial it could have educational multi-family it's going to have through traffic and you're going to have all of these other types of buildings besides just single-family residential so it may warrant some striping and some other features in order to slow traffic down but also provide everything that we keep saying that we want to see in a TND so we first start out based on again like any investigation it's like okay what are what's the feedback but we didn't just we went out and observed ourselves me and several of my staff members in the day in the morning and at night we also looked at different videos that people had taken and everything else okay and plus you know we're very familiar with all of the different plans as it's going on as you know I've been doing this for 12 years for the city so have a lot of history so we looked at a paupery from Shaman Metery all the way to Bonnet in particular at Bella Vista and Waterview and at Royals Lindbergh especially near principles list oceans especially at Edgemere right there by the school Shore Drive Royals got Waterview and then of course it's many years we were asked and in some areas not necessarily or sometimes not just a crosswalk but we looked at 92 in East Milton as a crosswalk some of the observations of course there's no lane there's no parking striping within the development except near what people refer to as the city center there's limited lighting and residential areas is that would be expected but by the same token if you're in the park area it's not very well lit up I stood there talking with some residents and watched a couple in near misses with people passing stop signs again you know just not necessarily speeding but shows you that a stop sign and a four way stop is not your answer to everything as popular belief might be we talk about it and we refer to it as a walkable community what if you have a walkable community side it doesn't stop at a sidewalk because every time they try to cross the street you're playing chicken so if you don't have a sidewalk if you don't have a crosswalk guess who has the right way the vehicle so if we want to make this a walkable community I'm looking at it and saying we can't have everybody play chicken and if you want a crosswalk at 92 you're not playing chicken from one industry to milk on all the way to the school so that's the kind of as the mayor said 30,000 foot level I'm looking at it with everything everybody's saying speed tables everybody wants a speed bump speed tables everybody knows that is not necessarily always the answer in out there in observation what we noticed is there are tons of lawn care companies coming in with their trailers so imagine being in the house that would be right outside of that speed bump so one of the things years ago when we talked about if people wanted speed bumps what Latvia does with Tony Tramble had said was you get 75% of the people on the street where the street bumps want to be to all be on it and then you show people where it needs to be based on engineering and 90% of the time nobody wants a speed bump if they know it's going to be but the amount of noise that it would make the safety it reduces emergency vehicles time to respond police and fire so and then you know buses everything so we looked at all of that and said that's just by watching everything that's not necessarily you know took that off the table and then of course lots of people don't necessarily like the through traffic it was built that it was designed that way it was designed the right way to have people you can't have that many hundreds of homes and it just be inclusive of itself it's not it's got commercial it's got schools it has to have through and that's exactly what it's supposed to and you have through traffic and river inch so that's just what you have you know so when we considered we looked at what we as engineers referred to as MUTCD the manual on unified traffic control devices that's the reason why all stop signs in the united states are red with white if you had to know a different color in Louisiana to Florida you wouldn't know how to drive so let's not make up a use of a traffic control device different in young's deal then it is somewhere else that's why we have that we looked at pedestrian safety yes speed reduction of vehicles we want to look at the response of emergency vehicles what's the what's the challenge with emergency vehicles right now and in the future the connectivity for the walkable community that we want it to be it's and everybody likes about it noise impacts impacts infrastructure another thing with speed tables speed bumps most of the corners where people would want them there's drainage structures right there we can't have them you know even in the neighborhood I lived in when it had it down on hundred oak strife the road on either side of it you would see the pavement degrading from the water sit there because nobody took into account that you changed the drainage pattern by putting a big speed table so to put a speed table in those areas we would have had we have to do all kind of curb work and everything so it's not as easy as people think put a little bit of asphalt so we looked at that when we and we wanted cost effective and functional the one thing I know from doing government work from 32 years of my life is that you have cost effective and functional and we all have budgets you all have budgets so we looked at that too and then the constructability of it what can we construct what can we make functional while people are living there this is not new this is the development people live in proper use of a four way stop stop signs or not for traffic calming let me say that again they are not for traffic calming you are not going to ever see Pam Grajane and most engineers say let's add a four way stop to calm traffic I sat there and watched people blow through stop signs that's not the purpose of them that is not how they are to be used you use four way stop four way stop signs when you have equal and opposite traffic so you got the same amount of traffic either way and you're trying to give everybody a chance to go intersections where there's accidents hard to maneuver dangerous site conditions all make sense near a school you're trying to do so and prior to doing that you should have notification let people know that you're going to have a stop sign coming through there so the answer to traffic calming is not stick four way stops all over the place traffic calming devices are speed bumps cushions humps tables that's just how big they are and how but it's all the same thing everybody says it just how wide they are how high chokers you can do diverters traffic circles which are around about but small but it's just a little many lane narrowing signage striping you can realign intersections you can divert you can raise them like what brusar just did at that intersection i'm brusar or you can do a median island many of those that you see are all structural we looked at different things you would be changing everybody's patterns they cost a lot more money the constructability takes longer so we focused in on lane narrowing signage and striping because that stuff that we felt was cost effective functional could be constructed and we don't have to deal with all the drain and gin everything so we focused the striping and signage and the only structural improvements that would be needed is those to extend some sidewalks that didn't quite line up and or to do any pipes that we need there's a couple areas we have to add some pipes to extend those sidewalks like at my principles list so the four ways the one four way stop that we saw is that oceans and edge mirror you have a school that lets out you have an intersection that's wide because it's a boulevard you have humongous boulders that are placed in the median so if someone is trying to maneuver on edge water they have to make sure that they miss the boulders and that they can cross while the while the traffic would not be stopping on oceans back-step traffic but we can see people playing chicken trying to race across it so that one because it makes it hard to maneuver there is a school nearby and because of how it's laid out it's best that that becomes a four way stop that's our recommendation posting 15 mile mile per hour speed limit whether it's signs or markings on the roadway letting everybody know you have 12 entrances and everybody needs to know when they come in the sugarmobot this speed limit's 15 miles an hour pedestrian crosswalks because we are recommending some crosswalks and they not only have to be striped but we need to have the proper signage and so we are recommending signs on either side and I'll have some graphics but also they make a sign that you put in the center of the road a small one that basically tells people it's the law you need to yield to pedestrians and a crosswalk and we're recommending those at Palfrey and Belavista Palfrey and Barton Terrace and Lynn Bergen Lake Christ and crosswalk with lighted signs flashing lights like what we have a day taught we are recommending at East Milton and and east west of Lake Christ so striping considerations or crosswalks with signs lane narrowing one thing you don't do is put a center line and a subdivision center lines just from all of studies and everything people's perception of a center line is well that's a roadway with a high speed and people tend to speed so we're not recommending center lines we're recommending edge lanes on the roadways that also have parking because in a roadway that's beyond 28 feet the driver senses I have full flexibility of all of this to drive and they have nothing that makes them slow down you may not notice it but when you're on a road and you see a white line coming out your right side you tend to slow down you tend to want to stay on that edge of that line and so it's there's a lot of things that our own psyche sees with regards to lines which is the whole reason why we're recommending on those roads that have parking on the side right now it's just all all you see is black pavement is to make sure that everybody knows where your travel lane ends and what is parking to desert and that is road narrowing because you're you're restricting the drivers that here's where you're supposed to drive and that has been proven to reduce speeds five to seven miles an hour in a residential area they have what's called optical speed bars I'll show you some examples of those but optical speed bars if as you put these and they're not really they're just striping you put them closer as you get towards the stop sign that you want to make sure people don't run because as they get closer you put the stop bars closer and it gives them the perception that they think that they're going faster and it will slow them down and so again it's a it's the way the mind looks at these lines and then stop bars again a lot of people might not notice that sign but people's eyes are on the road they notice what's on the pavement and so you lose a sign the wind goes down somebody hits the sign that's what you still have the stop bar everybody knows when they get their driver's license what that big 20 inch white bar is across the lane it's a stop bar speed limits again several of the there's lots of T&Ds that we looked at there were case studies around that different places had the same issue this is not Maryland Colorado several different ones and they some of them put speed what they called in in entrance improvements and it was speed limits on the roadway if the signs didn't work also you can put arrows on crosswalks it gives the illusion of a speed table but it's not it's showing an arrow towards a sidewalk but again it makes people slow down angled stripe if there's areas that people should be parked at and we had several when you're looking at the aerial imagery even though there's bulb outs to show when you're trying because there are several things that have been done in the design of the roadway trying to bulb out and people are parking on the other side of the bulb out and basically blocking traffic from being able to go through so sometimes you have to state the obvious to some people that you can't park there because now you're going to make it hard for a car to get around and then turn lane at Palfrey and Bonan so this is what we see how they have the arrows that are approaching this crosswalk and so this is not a raised crosswalk it's an ad grade crosswalk which you see the illusion that it gives you you're driving at night it brings a lot of attention for you to slow down in that particular area same thing with this one and you see the sign in the middle of the road alerting the driver and reminding the driver that there are the pedestrian has the right way that's the sign we're talking about this is speed bar the optical speed bars they can be any link they can be on the sides they can be halfway in the road but there were numerous examples of where they've used them you know country roads in in subdivisions approach to stop signs but that's what we're talking about it's not raised it is just paint many of them went to this I'm sure you've seen it I showed the mayor even in Ireland I saw pictures of where they're coming out around about people were coming too fast and they literally have slow and stuff like this on it so it's not uncommon whether you want to do slow or you want to do 30 miles in the 15 miles an hour to remind people who are not looking at the signage this is a stop bar you can do it with or without the word stop but again tells people exactly what they need to do but you'd be surprised how many people are just blowing through a stop sign so the recommendations we have at Paul free or crosswalks at Barton Terrace in Vela Vista to align the sidewalks so again that people can walk across play signage and striping do white lane edge lines parking striping and then the turn lane and bonnet with diagonal striping at broiles stop bars with the stop signs optical speed bars and speed limit striping at the side entrance and so here's some examples so here is where the park area is and you can see the crosswalks that we have on there so that people can see and we would have the signage appropriate I do believe in a couple of the areas you may have to you know we're recommending optical speed bars it may be something you do at first it may be something you come back and do but you may have to remind the drivers or do other things to make sure they slow down but that was areas where people were asking about speed bumps and I would not want to be those five houses that are sitting there as they have two speed bumps with trailers coming back and forth but all of they're all for those corners with the drainage we would have to adjust so as you get so again having a crosswalk across um what are you there again allowing people we're trying to get people to the park so let's give the pedestrian the right way to get to the park and not have to play chicken and then here is our intersection of broiles again I saw people blowing that stop sign there um at brawls and palfrey but we have that big wide open at palfrey right there by our commercial businesses it's just really wide open doesn't give when people come in doesn't give the illusion to make people slow down so our recommendation with the yellow striping is to have one lane you have one lane on one side and one on the other and then we're going to add a turn lane on to bonac is a lot of people turn left people who want to turn left get in the middle everybody's waiting to turn right you don't have enough room um and then we're also one of our other drawings of show we're also recommending a crosswalk right there we've got that beautiful sidewalk the city has spent money the developer has spent money but there's no way for you to get across the sidewalk to walk it right there so that's in essence what we would see that intersection you have a crosswalk people entering in the subdivision see they have one lane stay in your lane you have the left turn lane coming out you have the right turn lane so again it's an enhancement for traffic flow for pedestrian safety Lindbergh crosswalks at Lake Crest align the sidewalks and signage white lane edge lines park striped parking striping stop bars and then the speed limit striped because we know I mean I think we've heard from is it sergeant mostly now you know about how people really do not go 15 miles an hour there so there's a lot of parking there um again people come in while there might not be many people parked they're flying they've got 30 something feet of roadway that they can drive in and they're not slowing down so and while you're slowing people down I think a lot of people recognize okay there's parking spots right there and so I think there's more parking within this development than people think but when something's not striped some people might be like cannot park there what can I do there it gives you the clear indication as the driver where you can park where you cannot park um and then these cross the crosswalks as you can see we're trying again if we're going to get people from Sugar Mill pond to that crosswalk on East Milton I need to cross people and so to cross them that's a perfect place so not only to slow people down you've got that school there you've got people maybe walking their kids to principals list parking to be able to get their children and walking so to have crosswalks there but then to be able to allow them to cross use the sidewalk on the side of Sonic to eventually get to our sidewalk on East Milton so they can cross to go to school so again if you want to walk your kids to school I need to give you a safe way to get there not just the sidewalk not just a crosswalk in the middle and then how do you get there this is just more just and then the center that's not a center line striping that is literally just our stationing and what we used on our for our work that we would do for a contractor so that's not a center line striping it's just edge line and parking striping so broils crosswalks at the streets along broils again there's a lot of you got sidewalks but then every time you need to cross let's let those pedestrians have a way to get across and get to Lindbergh parking striping on broils in a lot of areas you have parking on both sides which that area of people are really using a higher speed because again they have a very very wide roadway just open to do whatever we are recommending some optical speed bars basically at Paul free and and then on the approach with with God so you see how they're parking on both sides again we measured based upon how far you're supposed to be from an intersection we don't want again if people are parking all the way up to an intersection blocking people from having a clear view so everything we took into account how far you're supposed to be from an intersection so that people can see where they're going so again you know nothing real stop complicated it's pretty straightforward and then where there isn't and again we stop as you can see we're stopping the parking because that way people recognize there's no designated parking in those other areas sure I mean you have this great park once again we want to be able to get people to be able to cross to get to the great park and all of the sidewalks that they have in that area so here optical speed bars speed limit at that entrance letting people know you're now in sugar mill it's 15 miles an hour you can pass through but you need to slow down and so again allowing and putting some crosswalks for the connectivity so people from the west side of shore can safely get to the park in the center and can cross and we can slow people down and let them know that the pedestrian has the right of way oceans the four-way stop at edge mirror we can choose to do stop ahead signs or optical speed bars again there's parking there it's it's very wide people go very fast right now that area is still being built out so there's a lot of people that don't slow down thinking I got all this room to move and they use it so again striping to let people know that there's parking on the side and slowing them down with that edge lane and then optical speed bars as they approach that four-way stop making sure and then striping that up until the city center got in water view again the the white lane edge lines the park striping in the stop bars thing oh there you go and there's your Milton crosswalk so on that one we would have some extra because again we want to make sure to slow people down so there'll be some extra arrows that again that illusion that crosswalk example that I show Joe um what's in black that's where we have to extend the sidewalk so we have to go from the roadway to the sidewalks you have on either side we have to put a small piece of culvert to make that happen in the ditch um but that one would have the button to press to be able to cross just like you do on daytime so at this point thank you Pam at this point the the only one that I can tell you that we are unless there's objection from the council that we are moving ahead with for certain is going to be this east Milton crosswalk because this is something that we've had conversations and we hope to replicate in other areas around the community um closer to the city hall around like the revive area to get in a traffic from the thousand plus homes that are in copper field across to across iberia to the sidewalk which will eventually be the linear park and so forth um so that we plan to move ahead with I know that um in tonight I'm not asking the council to take any action on this um I would like for the the the neighborhood the development the developers maybe have some internal discussion since we're here I'd certainly welcome it's not actionable but if there's unless there's objection from the council I would like to hear from anyone that wishes to address the council after the council has an opportunity to comment about it uh clearly there's maybe some things that you like don't like that may give you pause our intention if we do move ahead with any or all of this would be we're we're going to request pricing for striping um regardless because we have some other striping work that we want to do across our city we just begin that process of doing some of our refreshments some of our roundabouts of shimmimettory road bone and road we want to do some shimmimettory parkway phase two like which is guillot towards south side so we have other striping work to do um we can add some of this stuff incrementally we can do none of it we can do all of it uh we we work for you guys ultimately we when we hear there's a problem we love the opportunity to try to troubleshoot and solve the problem um I did you know I know that I won't speak for the chief but I do know that I believe they've increased some some traffic enforcement within the neighborhood um so perhaps that's enough um but I wanted to share this for to kind of um for informational purposes for the council for the residents of that neighborhood and um I'll maybe open it for council questions or or thoughts right now Mr. or Mara Pam this last one we've been talking about this for years I feel like Terry have a living you know something are we lower in speed there is that how that's happening or we're just able to well we're already at 35 now so originally when we were talking about that that was back when we went 45 miles an hour so we're at 35 miles an hour you can lower it if you want to choose to lower it in that area but I think you know the whole idea is if you have it flashing and you have it signed enough and you have your optical speed bars I think it's um you know because day taught is 35 as well no I'm just glad to see it because I know we talked about it for years and it seems like if someone who has teenagers sonic is like the place to hang out yeah and they all go there after every event they come from Shreemopan, Kostri, my neighborhood everywhere so that that's great to see uh the only other thing I had to was on oceans and edge mirrors and so that is that it's that the signs are already up and covered is that right yes okay I've seen people slowing down and actually stopping so it's gonna work because I've seen people fly through there when it was first opened up and so I think just the illusion of having those signs I've even let it recovered that's a great spot too but this is great phenomenal job thank you man councilman shop on thank you mayor thank you Pam great presentation um I see a lot I was some of the board members of here I'll read our neighbors in Shreemopan I'd like to hear from y'all if you don't mind I know it's been a lot it's a lot to absorb just seeing it for the first time I get it but maybe if y'all don't mind whoever wants to get up please come and give us your suggestions and thoughts thank you mayor yeah hi y'all doing there I think y'all probably know me by now uh I want to thank y'all I want to thank you Pam awesome that this is you know and that's what we're supposed to do just like y'all we're a board we represent our neighborhood and we're trying you know somebody has a problem we we try to find a solution for and and you know this is this is awesome it's a lot to digest okay and you know I think sitting down now that we have this let us if we can get copies of it the presentation so that we can you know it on our own pace look at it and see um give you a little bit of history uh four and a half years old christmas Eve I wrote my tri-cycle out into the street I was at a coma for twelve hours all right I'm lucky to be walking because the the tri-cycle handlebar missed my spine by less than half an inch punctured lung head concussion uh it's not where we want to be okay at one is the person that got hit two is my parent mom that's watched it in my neighbor that witnessed it uh and I'm sure the lady that hit me uh had nightmares over it too so our neighborhood is different than other neighborhoods and that we we want the people sitting on the porches we want people walking we like visiting with our neighbors um but that does come at a cost and I don't think even in our neighborhood that our people really understand this concept the traditional neighborhood that they don't even realize why this be limits fifteen miles an hour in sugar mill pond versus twenty miles an hour in other neighborhoods in young spill and it's fifteen miles an hour because we are closer to the street okay we park on the street you know it only takes a split second for a kid to walk out between two cars and you're not going to see them all right and to stop so we need to do something to slow people down um I appreciate JP and that has made a difference yeah I'll mention one little town does anybody speed through golden meadow no because you will get a ticket in golden meadow so you know a police presence is just a reminder and if they stay long enough then you know people in their minds they go well you know what I'm gonna get caught if I do this so I need to slow down and there's enough neighborhoods in the young's bill to where you know maybe one solution would be if he had you know a few more officers and they rotated subdivisions stay a month at a time uh that it would it would slow people down now I'm lucky I'm retired so I don't have to be in a hurry to go anywhere but I understand you know life's a rat race people always in a hurry but thank y'all so much now for working with us yeah working with the developer yeah I'm a like I said we're we're all trying to find the right solution so thank y'all thank you mr. Andrew and yes absolutely we'll give you the presentation will be public records so we'll be happy to provide it Miss Cindy hey how are y'all good um a couple of questions fam um how free and boning you said that we would look at adding a turn lane for left when we just not turn left there's like there are 12 incenses to the neighborhood and five four of them are roundabouts why are we even taking a left out of it what what would that do study wise for the traffic you can tell people not to turn left good luck no no I mean you got a 40 foot wide roadway good you know or whatever it you're good luck telling someone they can't turn it right there the difference is there if you have a dedicated left into the subdivision it's never going you have quite a few hundred feet it's not going to back up to hold anybody okay so if it was a left turn that I was adding off of 90 off a bone that's a problem that's a problem that's a problem but you're in the subdivision so let the people who want to turn left instead of going around to sit there and let everybody who's turning right get a lane okay because if I don't do it right now I've been one of those where I'm trying to turn right to come here from leaving the dentist office and there's a bunch of people trying to wait to turn left so I mean it's a you know you have the room to make it a left and I think even if we were to stripe it where they can't people are going to get in there and they're going to turn left or they're still going to get on yours it is very hard without putting a structural device there okay to you know like a like a trying which people I mean have you watched people buy rouses like it does no good so my thing is they're gonna do it they're gonna do it so let's give them a lane to do it now once the roundabout in the future is built at 92 in Prescott right then that might be alleviated at that point in time depending on how it comes out stretch the stretch is so much smaller yes okay so that's question one question to oceans from Lindbergh to powdery okay that is a very long stretch even with the edge line that we're that is being considered what would the impact of putting a crosswalk of some sort or something from those people who live on not oceans broil I'm sorry yes you did say I mean you know there's a lot of streets um broils from Lindbergh to powdery is a straight shot with you talked about that with parking on both sides with parking on both sides even with the edge lane right those people who live on broils to cross over what's proposed is go to Lindbergh or go all the way down to powdery what would be because that's a long stretch what would be the impact of putting a crosswalk from broils over one of the intersecting street one of the intersection because that is such a long stretch I mean if we can do another I mean if that's with that's not there's not a problem that is one of our most complained about lanes and then sure obviously was I'm glad that you looked at not just powdery park but getting people to the pond right next question so harbor intersection harbor and shore that is coming around that's going to come all the way back around and hit oceans now I'm on the right street what that's going to be a long stretch also without any if if I read the plans correctly yeah that's a very long stretch around the pond that isn't going to have anything obviously the street's not even there yet but to keep that in mind because I think that might become a potential spot once it is developed and I know that is coming sooner than later I think that's a great point and I think one of the things that we can do we don't have those plans yet you're I'm sure you're referring to the to the to the master plan of what we anticipate happening there you know I think that'd be a great opportunity where we could encourage the design engineer and the developer if there is opportunity to do a traffic so yeah like similar that's on like Annembourg we did we did have at least one of those proposed in another spot in the neighborhood I know I just I shared it with Lulu and Clayton recently but you know I think we can keep that in mind now that we yeah we the regular neighborhood standards I guess if you will for our for our city every 1500 feet has to have something like that because Sugar Mopon has been governed under a traditional neighborhood development ordinance it hasn't been something that we've really held the development accountable to but I think it's still a great practice that's worked well in our subdivision regs that we should probably carry over as well well and some of that didn't some of that get resolved with the adoption of the new T&D ordinance that I don't think some of it with the parking yeah the parking on oceans commercial parking that will be straight yes that was already part of that T&D change yeah okay thank you Pam you thanks Miss Dindy anyone else wishes to address the council relative hate how are you man hi I'm Miss Dindy there's the other Dindy as an educator for 33 years I'm very excited to see the crosswalks and all that because I feel like in Sugar Mopon the kids would love to walk to school but it's just not safe to do so I'm very excited to see the crosswalks to see all this happening if it does happen all of it happening for the neighborhood to just be filled with the kids on their bikes going to school going to events doing all these things and not have to worry about how they're going to get there and how they're going to get back so I really like this idea and I just wanted to say from the educating educators perspective not the engineer but from the educators perspective I just love this because I feel like it's going to be it's going to make things easier for kids to travel to go where they want to go to get to the park to get to school to get to the sports to get anywhere they want to go I like the whole idea so thank you thanks miss David thanks miss Dindy I'm glad she's got that so my my son goes to Arca too and I think this is awesome because the community is supposed to be a walkable community so thank you for all your hard work mayor thank you for like taking the time to always talk to us and thank you JP for you know being there so quickly to help us with our speed like you know like Pantheid we are in a different type of neighborhood and I think it's you know everyone needs to realize that we have so much mixed use so much commercial and that's why we're getting all the traffic so as one of the board members we you know we just want the residents to know that we hear them and you know we're here thank you yes ma'am miss Grinrod thank you all for considering that I am we live on Monte Go Bay that wasn't one that was mentioned and it might be already part of it but quarter of tabs and like work taz is Lindbergh it is a hot zone they come in hot they turn in hot everything is hot well illustrated so if we I love the idea of the crosswalks but I'm also a big fan if you already even consider that the you know the speed limit on the road with across anything and everything you are willing to do I'm open to it apart from the speed bumps which y'all have ruled out so I just wanted to say that yeah just don't forget about those probably already mentioned the streets but if you have it far enough those please add those especially the ones getting into it yeah thanks Carol yeah and that's a good point because that is a continuation of of broils and a lot of in a lot of cases so I guess to anyone else yes sir hey guys first of all I want to say thank you to you fantastic presentation I never spoke to you about arcade arc uh and when you visited with the schools telling them to slow down it worked okay these guys thank you all right but with that being said I do want to speak to you about and I spoke to Simone about this basically coming off of highway 92 pulling into sugar mill pond which brings us straight down to our blue boils right where those buses turn they come around our roundabout right there at Prescott the roundabout at Prescott okay I spoke to Simone about that and the problem that we have is I'm up I'm up at 330 every morning okay and I do a lot of things between 330 and six and visiting and watching I know you said you were out there a few times um we have too much traffic and which you said that their community was built to that to to have that type of traffic problem that we have is we have individuals and families and buses that are taking shortcuts into the neighborhoods even though they're not picking up children at that point in time is there any way that we can possibly have or instruct those buses to take the long way around instead of putting our kids in jeopardy that that are around that area and I'm sure at that point in time when you were there at the 530 mark we have kids that are sitting out on the side of right there at boils right by the top room these kids are coming I don't speed in neighborhoods but I can tell you that I can't see them okay I can't see them and I'm taking my time I know they're there but I can't see them that's all around and that goes all the way down boys so I'm asking that we eliminate the buses from turning left there at certain time frames okay send them around and prevent preventing them from going down those avenues because it's it's too dangerous for the children down there sure has come down with the buses JP your guys have done a fantastic job of patrolling that I appreciate it but I do want to talk about the presentation that you did it was fantastic but I think we forgot out one thing when you mentioned the mental side of it psyche of it is majority of the people that are running the stop signs and speeding in these areas are individuals that constantly are traveling our market our town our area so these are going to be familiarities right so I'm not sure that I think at the very get go it's going to do good okay and I think it would be fantastic but I think once we get used to it it's not going to work as well so I don't want to I think incorporating everything is a fantastic but also think that we need to still concentrate on writing big tickets okay letting the tickets ride and and handling it from there I don't want anybody getting hurt on any roads because they're speeding okay and the buses they don't if they don't need to be there then why are they there I understand the connectivity okay I understand that but this in these situations they they can go around and not put any kids in jeopardy because we don't have a lot of kids that are on the main road except from here two broils where the um or to the top sugar mill pond that is where I noticed that a lot of kids with their parents are on the side of the road collecting buses because the buses stop right there okay along those roads but when you travel around going towards let you know we take 92 we go we go south and then we turn left and go and run to school we don't have children along those roads okay so listen to our buses around and try and try to help our children because it only takes one small child to get away from a parent and every one of us are parents and every one of us had a child get away from us so let's try to possibly fix that and ask you a question so at that time since you're a yes I'm not up at three there so at the time when they're making the left so they're coming around brawls and they're making basically they're making a left is at that same time any traffic backed up on 92 because of so the so the net golet yeah is that is it happening at that time at the same time that 92 pulling in you know everybody at that point 99% of the people turn right okay coming out of that top when we go we go right coming to city hall 99% of the people do it every once in a while you get somebody on the left hand side I wouldn't mind you putting the left hand turning lane there okay um but that's okay so the traffic does back up to an extent let's say people are polite to buses okay I'll say that so they allow them to turn more and quicker but I would say average seven deep when turning left from coming from here and about how many buses you you would say how many we we think I'm gonna say at least six to I'm gonna say at least six to seven okay and I'm not I can't I have somewhere in that range so you're saying in that right less than two numbers yes yes yes but more than five yes I believe so and but again I want to say your conversations were slowing down the buses absolutely helped you and I spoke about it you sending the guys and the guys taking big interest I saw a regional out there doing measurements where you can have make sure everything's on video he's done that fantastic the H.O.A they're listening they're listening to us we give them help don't get me wrong but they're listening okay and and I believe Simone has done a very good job of speaking up for us up here and I believe you guys are listening down that avenue all that powerful stuff that stuff that we've been asking for for a very long time you know we've even that crosswalk you know I'm not and let me let me say something I am okay with the crosswalk well cross from the sonic but that needs to be lit up like a Christmas group period okay that's just everything in the nutshell all right I can I don't mind having the golf carts on the roads and things that are legal and all that kind of stuff but we are a community of consistently running the same roads running the same red lights running the same stop signs speeding down the same roads so all of these avenues that you've put together JP is done and with you communicating is gonna help us okay but you can't let one go yeah okay you can't let one of them go I just want to tell mr. Seville Terry and I had spoken about 92 in press and he suggested which I don't know if they're working on he had suggested no left turn off a 92 into press god yes that's beautiful I wouldn't mind a certain time frame okay I wouldn't mind a certain time frame of limiting that because you go we go to the school zones we have from seven and nine okay eliminating that and writing the ticket and and and that also goes with buses yeah buses are buses but they take the roundabout if you were there then you saw the roundabout you saw how they took the roundabout okay nothing else to say about that okay so in and there's tearing up the roads that are right there at the roundabout we have the entrance way from 92 at Shigamopan that's going to hell and back okay these are these are all things that are there so I know I've taken I didn't raise my hand wait I apologize yeah well I asked questions yeah in your defense I asked you questions look I last time I was here I had to raise my hand you can't limit a bus fully public ride now if your community was gay you can limit it all you want but it's for us telling a bus he can't use a public right away I don't see that's a we can't we're I'm asking this and look you're you're a lawyer you're smart guy right so we can't say from this time frame to this time frame the left turn that may be possible but what I heard from you what I heard from you is excluding buses from the neighborhood that we can't do now can we put a turn lane in and alleviate some of that possibly I can understand okay and it's a public road yeah and I think once the roundabout on Prescott and 92 yeah woobo 92 and the entrance to Prescott that may be a while because of funding but that will alleviate a lot of that but it's possible maybe the no left turn from 92 onto Prescott might help well we also have a problem and we spoke about you spoke about it and you said that the stop signs are already slowing people down I'm not going to disagree with you I believe is where the archeschool is where they're putting up the four way and it has the big stones look I get that the problem that we have there is we're allowing people to stop on that mate on that roadway okay they stop and wait in traffic lines that's where a traffic line is and no it's it's I understand but it's truly at the end of the day we get in trouble for things it's not legal okay it's not legal be stopped on the road it's not a turning lane it's not set up that way it's not anything there's no there's no hook for them to stay in there no lines there's no nothing there's no signs there's no nothing right right come on where the four ways stopped going yeah the high school the middle school uses that to load to load up for parents the parents stop on the main road lane okay so you're talking about the other version you know you mean Savoy but it's a lot more emotional than that's της your facing your okay so yeah that's yeah that's not going to work either in the long term that's not going to Nigeria because but now I will say only for me is um I'm not telling you I was driving looking down I am going to say that I was driving and um all of a sudden I pulled up on some cars that were sitting on the side of the road okay simple okay um it's there's nothing there I I personally don't think that they should be there did this is behind arca yes right on that yeah where where we have those where you put in the new stop signs that matter which is unusual because there's four lanes is that right I think my life's cool keep it a mollie in the middle school typically lineup in behind the sports complex parking whether it be the soccer area or the baseball area the high school pickup parents are the ones that are lining up on edge mere going in that way yeah it's it's more of the high school okay so high school pickup we so it's a high school pickup high school pickup in the afternoon yeah okay and that's and that's where it is okay okay now I'm agree with you yeah I'm agree with you that's something that I will we'll look into and probably why we're seeing that more right now they're high school enrollments growing that that's where we're seeing the biggest I think growth and that they've had it classes picking up children more parents are picking up their children for them back and forth I get it I understand and yeah that's part of bringing people in from outside of the communities right that's just part of you know buses ain't bringing them parents gonna bring them mom and dad I understand but that still doesn't if I would have hit them honestly I called it at the last second I would I would have thought well and there's still construction going on there I think we had there's one house that has the has the dumpster in the street so I mean it's a it's a lot going on in that area I was going back to the buses what buses are you seeing in for me is it LP SS or ARCA is ARCA L the ARCA let me let me let me let me yeah so I'm going to say both of them travel our roads okay but I am going to say ARCA has done a very good job of slowing down okay I'm not saying to laugh you a pair of school board buses haven't slowed down I am going to say that when I'm big this 6 6 oh 5 6 15 so forth and so on they do have a suburban that you can come get on Tuesdays that fly through the neighborhood at six something in the oh bo with that's all I got you put a lot of effort into it and we appreciate no we want y'all be back every aspect of it has to be followed because the part I want to go back and I want to say one more time it's the psyche you talked about it once we get used to it it's not going to mean anything to us it's going to mean something to somebody else it's coming into the neighborhood but it's going to be in passing okay so it could slow them down but it's not going to slow them down not going to slow them down once we get there it's not going to slow me down at the end of the day because I'm used to it okay it's just that's what I think yeah I think we have to do everything together oh it's multifaceted I think we we completely agree I mean we can't have one without the other allocated time for the next five meetings so on the six meeting you will be allowed to speak just a couple a couple thoughts that I have just well Keith did you did you want to make another point I realized legally we can't stop buses from using the streets but that doesn't mean that we can't ask the superintendent who lives in Sugar Mill pond to get control of the buses and think about the kids okay and let them do that voluntarily and we all do not have to tell them or take children I'm going down shore one day and my golf cart is set for 15 miles an hour right so if you run up on me you speeding all right bus ran up on me school system bus not arka I stop I got out the cart I said you need to slow down I said I can't believe you drive kids around it you driving like this oh I wasn't speeding okay so you know maybe we need to reach out to the superintendent and you know well right and he likes to let everybody know that he is the superintendent right well so a couple things first let me say this in in in fairness and in defense of the superintendent I think he's extremely responsive to everything that I've ever brought to him and I'm happy to do this I think I think one common denominator that we're here and is we have a lot of school traffic because when I hear that we have you know the traffic and all these things my follow up question typically is do you notice it's different in the summer or when school's out and I haven't met a person that hasn't unequivocally at that moment said yes absolutely so it helps define what our issue is a little bit more and just specific to the superintendent I don't I don't want to speak for him but I did make arka earnest golet has such a long car queue line well some funding was just approved there to build another wing to remove the portable buildings one day I think Haley and I were walking out of a meeting that the superintendent was with who were walking to our vehicles together and I said hey when you do that renovation there anything you can do to extend that car queue line because guillette has has a very big property there it was this impassant in our car within a week he followed up with me twice on the same thing which I had no expectation to that he would because he wanted to brainstorm how could how could it be done and how could we do it because ultimately you know that longer car queue line even if it's just for that 15 20 minute period can help prevent people from cutting through and things like that your neighborhood the intersection that mr. savel is talking about we we know that that's an issue hence the reason that we're about 75% designed on it we have a traffic circle design there that's going to match the one by shabils in fact arka when they opened their last build in it was a requirement that they contribute to it and they did so with that said I mean we're working on that we have the right way obtained for it we have talked about interim solutions there I don't think any of them would be overwhelmingly popular but we have talked about restricting left churns in now that's that is something that we can consider it can be at certain times what I would want to know those if we do it there at a certain time where will we see what what effect may that have on other areas but that's some that's research we can look into there is going to be another road that's going to be cutting through in that sea island lane when you head home this evening it's the first it's the first street in sturmopon phase 20 so that road is going to have a left churn lane off of iberia into sea island so anybody that's looking for property on sea island lane beautiful lots they're going to be fantastic front loaded but be on notice that that is going to be a street that is going to cut through and it is going to connect eventually to the back of arka I do think that that'll help long term for there to be some disbursement of traffic there as well but mr. savela every conversation I've had with the headmaster at arka she is more than responsive so we're fortunate to have her as well as the superintendent that are very dialed into our community I'll talk to them about I mean my assumption had been that buses in a neighborhood are for the purpose of picking up or dropping off kids but you're right it is possible since the school is in the neighborhood I mean maybe maybe it's an empty school bus you know issue so I'll lean in a little bit you know more respective to that I see okay okay okay yeah so it's a it's it's a bus of students that are going through the neighborhood to the school okay and as possible maybe they're not using the we we leaned in at one point to south side and Pam very quickly told me they're not using it as we laid out and we designed for them I don't want to conflate their issue with this one but it's possible that maybe we do need to review that a little bit more in depth I do have a question from mr. savel earlier when we were talking about the people that are I guess parked on edge mere for the high school is does anyone can anyone tell me if at that point is the queue line that is on the campus of arka full or is it because arka is not letting them on the okay that we need to talk about so again the traffic transportation plan the difference between golet those people on that line are let in as early as one o'clock the reason we have the issue at the sports complex and everything else is never in the traffic planned it's someone say but oh by the way they're not let on our campus to a certain time I think we need to have some discussions in how that is used because that is not when it was approved that was not the case there was nothing saying they're gonna stay out in the streets for an hour whatever so we do need to they they have a plenty long they have a long queue line I recognize they may have to have people out there I get that yeah but that if imagine if we didn't allow if if Latvia Parish school board did not allow people on in that line by golet what that would do to highway 92 and that's I think an issue we think that's a great point and and and and honestly frankly I think if you if if if it's an operational decision that they don't want to do it well then don't queue in the streets either because you have a solution that you can and that is we we spend a lot of time with them so this may be in this traffic study yeah so this may be in this traffic study they originally were letting them line up but then they were lining up down the street so then they stopped that instead of being you can't get you can't dip in here until a certain time because they were lining up in the queue but then they were going down the street having them line up in the sports complex they're all there and no one is on the street right that's how that that that's the how the boy the entrance to avoid handled for middle school and that that comes first so we couldn't have elementary and three five long long long middle school the only one that uses the back of the I think it may warrant a discussion mayor what I'd like to open up is again and now that they're doing things in place no different than south side I think what happens is the people the way it's being operated today is not the same way you have engineers and you have contractors and everybody starting it before so it would warrant a discussion to come up with a solution as to how they manage it but how we can manage the traffic I've personally been stopped by a mom while I'm trying to walk on Savoaro because I wasn't waiting for a kid like out of her car everything all the things so I think it would warrant a discussion for us to sit down because I think I think from an operational we can try to help figure it out and something but that's that's why I wanted to ask mr. Sevelle because I'm thinking they're supposed to be queuing up in that in those lanes that they have so great information I appreciate I appreciate the input actually actually I just believe it's a beautiful model line uh oh I had another picture of it okay uh yeah and the thing isn't like Molly Molly will say it but the board raised line up at sports conference but the highest school does they line up and so now if I'm looking to buy a lot yeah chances tell me by the line that's going to have every evening is way up for it's going to go to my house one yeah so maybe or can these go on the high school level okay yeah we'll pay it yeah we'll pay it yeah we'll pay I think mr. Boussord wanted to say something that's a very good problem that is more middle school and high school so then in the morning time and also and I'm ready early early in the morning so above it's also out with you um those cars that are parked there are waiting to leave the children onto the bus to go to the high school and then it pick up and become that bigger issue because there are more cars which I've noted they are not people in the neighborhood so I'm not sure how they're people probably confused. Campbell so that might be a discussion because we are all lined up on that road yeah there are homes there's some kind of your tape people know high school is there yeah this is yeah the we'll yeah we'll get out no it's great information we'll we'll get out there and pay my visit and and uh you know as you know as all of you know I mean I haven't seen arca have a problem they haven't been able to solve that that that car rider line appears to be the the I mean you got numbers and lanes and all kinds of stuff so I think I think if we post to them I'm optimistic if we post to them the reality of what's happening yeah oh barricades now too say I see safety vessel say all kinds of stuff over there so it any anyone else that's still wishes to address the council uh well then one one additional thing I want to say is it didn't come up so as you go back and have the neighborhood meeting and have further discussion about it one of the observations I have I don't know that it's a concern again I want I want the development the residents to let us know if we were to take this plan that was just presented to us and enacted fully uh pilfery from uh basically uh what if you broil all the way to uh shimmy mettery would have parking restricted to the one side with the cutouts so I just want to point that out because I I'm very I'm very I was very I was specific to say hey what we're trying to resolve right now is traffic calming this has one mechanism in conjunction with enforcement we have an opportunity should it be the will of the people to address the parking there as well I know that's a lot of that's a whole nother discussion my personal opinion if I was being asked to solve this today singularly I would say let's do it in incremental phases while parking this is disruptive to some and that six and seven hundred block it's been a long standing allowable tradition that's been there yeah so I just want to throw that out because that's something that you guys need to digest and tell us we'll I will do whatever is the will of the people I just know if we implement this those that are parking on the north side of pilfery gotta go this has been a um it's been a hot topic for a while and I know it came up I discussed it here with y'all when we were discussing the the amendment to the tnd ordinance which was my and my concern was the fire trucks right emergency vehicles getting down pilfery in that section um after riding with um the Santa Claus I rode with the Santa Claus through sugarmob on on the fire truck um I cannot think of the name of it right now yes that um and it's tight I mean the the the driver it's tight and I know Lindy can attest to how tight it is so when my when I asked about it I was told by the developer that it was they intentionally allowed people to park on both sides to slow down the traffic but now it's gotten to the point where you can't even you you can't you can't have too far as there it's a waiting thing it's an intersection issue it's those kind of things um I do know that our community manager had put out um for our request uh about you know parking where it is in dinner which is designated parking some of that got pushed back um some of it didn't so I think that the incremental adding of this would be very kind to the board uh because we'll hear it um and I understand I mean that a lot of people have you know the parents and their kids are driving or whatnot they have more than two cars it's two car garages they got their golf cart and I 100% understand that um as a person who parked on the street for six years because the golf cart had the spot um I get it put it at the same time I think our safety of our neighborhood is is is important um and again I I think that that section they were told from the get go because most of those residents have been here the whole time and I think that's part of it is they were told park on both sides it'll slow down the traffic so they're going off of what they were told and yeah I agree I agree with what you're saying which is why I just know for the historical context I mean again it can be that you know so all right any other comments or questions please we're talking about parking so if you want to address that I'm sorry every single one the area that you're speaking I'm sorry where you where you spoke about the six hundred seven block that is slender right no ifans or butts about it um if you move vehicles from the north side which has parking on that road for for every single home on that road has a vehicle sitting in front of it 90% of the people that are on that road might be 60 and above okay that's not going to work yeah okay period okay I'm not going to speak for them I promise you if they look at the meeting it's going to be all over Facebook but that is not going to work I understand lindie I'd lindie Blair if we would have had a problem getting a fire truck down there those guys would have already been on top of and told us to move all that I'm sure that they're they're capable of maneuvering that type of stuff but we got older people in that neighborhood on that street that don't have the parking inside that garage okay those are the smaller homes you didn't get in two cars in that garage and those are two family homes two car families and golf cart the majority of those are golf cart homes right there too so I don't know if that will be used to be handled like that again I just a good point though when you brought up that's a great talking point but that's not we'll fight you on that one yeah and and and know that again this is all scalable I just that's something that we'd had not talked about and I just wanted to make it clear because all right anything else from members of the council mr. Mayor yeah I mean I know we're not taking action or anything like that we don't need to but I just highly encourage the East Milton crosswalk the two parks crosswalks and especially in front of principles lists I've been down that road when they're dropping off and picking up there needs to be designated parking there I mean I think that would be the thing I would move immediately on those items I think and Bob I just want to say sort of the buses and this isn't an excuse for LPSS but I've got a kid in the system and they have less bus drivers less buses because they're broken down and they're overloaded so guarantee the transportation department and parts of it in that in school board members don't know that they're cutting through so it's good that you brought it up because hopefully they can that I guarantee that wasn't the route designated for them to go because there's no pickup through there if there's a pickup through there it makes sense yeah yeah I'm gonna attack I'm gonna get on that right away so I think I opened by saying the only thing that we are moving ahead with is for now is gonna be the smelting crosswalk it does take time for strippers and all that to get lined up but but the the culverts and things like that we intend to probably do in-house so we'll start look or at least looking at that for getting it into the queue but none of this is gonna be overnight you know so it's just a matter of I don't know that we can we'll we'll review our capacity in-house and if not if need be we'll we'll start moving on that from outside and then as there's new developments new conversations within the development we'll stay in touch Mr. Neilin the crosswalk for East Milton when it goes across is it just going into grass or are we gonna put a sidewalk no we're extended sidewalk I would never put it in okay that's what that's what the drawing it's the drawing it there was a black piece on each side and that was the extension of the sidewalk we're making that it connects to golet and the neighborhood oh that's one okay yeah yeah we already have sidewalk on golet we already have so there's already sidewalk there so we're literally just have to cross the ditch on both sides to connect to it so yes all right all right well thank you all great feedback and I'm sure the residents will watch and digest it further and look forward to helping with this anyway we can and chief I'm assuming you'll just you'll stay the course with what you're doing there as well so yes all right thank you very much all right we'll go ahead and move on to ginottum 3.3 our Lafayette parish council member stands various here this evening and I would like to give us an update great conversation it was very solving problems that's what we do right what's that I do great job family and citizens coming out supporting it's awesome well good evening mayor council citizens thank you all for having me today today I'm gonna briefly talk about the election that's coming up this Saturday if you didn't know about it there's two mille drenules so these are they have to be renewed every so often so this is every 10 years and they have to be voter approved very very important to note these are not new taxes or tax increases this is what we're already paying there we go we're we're getting there so I want to talk about the two of them real quick the first one is that's going to be on the ballot road and bridge maintenance mille generates about 12.7 million a year it will it supports the resurfacing and reconstruction of roads widening projects bridge replacements and even basic maintenance like moan along public roadways and short it keeps our transportation network safe and usable on the right hand side you'll see the public health and safety mille it generates about 10.8 million a year and this one really supports a lot of services we interact with in ways we may not always see the drainage animal shelter mosquito control rural fire protection we've definitely made some some progress this year in the last couple years actually and we still more progress needs to be made it's not the finish line but we're doing we're doing more and then also the the corner services and public health programs so these are the behind-the-scenes systems that keep our community safe healthy and functioning so in 2024 the so again these are already paying these they're already at work so in 2024 the the road and bridge mille help fund multiple bridge replacements over two million dollars and road overlays and repairs the public health and safety mille help clean over 67 miles of roadside ditches invested in drainage improvements and supported fire protection across the parish and again so all right so this is what you're going to see on the ballot you can visit laughyatla.gov backslash mille and you can get more information on these milleages again hope you you know can support them that's what I'm asking today and really I want to thank y'all for all that you do for our community and thank you and if you have any questions any questions for councilman standsbury all right thank you can great seeing you appreciate the

properties LLC located section 1 t 11s are for e it sees that mr. noelle doing it all right mr. noelle welcome sir good evening mayor and council i'm sending you a permit rate plaque to create a subdivision for shemet properties as mentioned earlier it's currently two existing lots that go to open about same company they go burdened the one and then space them out into free individual lots for residential use there have been multiple versions of this plaats minute to city youngsville and after a furrow study we do recommend that we accept this recent plaque with some public additions for those who don't know this is a long shemetary road in between anzle drive and wild rose lane give an idea where is that and there's a very thin stretch of land that can access these lots a dedicated ride a passage we do recommend that this ride a passage doesn't complete any drainage easements or any green space there's also a few minor legal description issues to be solved there's also some extra notes need to be either edited or removed and with that open the council for feedback all right is there any comment or council for a comment from the members of the council i think i saw mr. Carter here mr. Carter would you wish i addressed the council sir yeah mr. nile get it so just for for memory purposes i believe they came before us as a group of friends who had bought this land and then they just want to be able to build their forever homes on these lots i think that's what maybe yeah maybe can deal with with somebody i think that's a good question we've we've heard this before so maybe just for context pammer garrick maybe you know can you all remind the council what what's the difference now well when they when they first came before you it was before for to get some clarification and variances before yeah for the road yeah that's what they were asking for at that point in time as they submitted different preliminary plots and adjusted based upon that and then adjusted based upon the requirements we've been reviewing those internally and this is the first time that we actually bring the preliminary plot to you guys but before they were asking they wanted they were trying to cost estimate what they could do whatever before they did that so this is the first time they actually come to officially plot it but yes you are correct there it's three it's three individual families that want but by our definition that is a subdivision all right and does and does require regulations thanks pammer all right mr. Carter yeah we're just here to answer the public have anything on it to address anything okay essentially thank you sir let's see council and shampoen motion to approve all right as a motion by councilman shampoen second by council member Romero this is a public hearing so anyone that wishes to address the council made do so is there any council comment anyone wishing to address the council all right if there's no public comment misgidry please call the vote for the approval of shamed properties llc mr. Romero yes mr. nylon yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes motion to approve all right thank you guys appreciate it all right other business agenda 7.1 bid review for highway 92 improvements I know this is a late entry of the details into your packet pam can go over the the details with you I'll also tell you that we opened the bids yesterday two bidders and I think she summarizes it really nicely there for you in the letter yes I mean this I think a long and short of it I think it's one of the least expensive projects we've done but it's making the mayor more excited than the water treatment plant let's just put it that way and this is for the two left for the three left turn lanes that we are doing as interim improvements along highway 92 to facilitate those left turns into center saw cell and on to a saint blaze and the opposite direction that sometimes we all get stuck behind so it's that so we had two bidders our original engineers estimate was 500 7000 our low bid was Glen layshae construction with 527 thousand so as that is $20,000 over 4% that's within what we would believe is acceptable should the council we're recommending you approve it I don't think if you rebid it or if we there's nothing we can take out the lanes or is we're already confined with what we have so our recommendation is to award for the $20,000 difference so I'm at 20,000 not millions all right councilman shopper motion to approve all right let's see now we do have there's a memo at your seats you will need to amend the budget uh additionally they're here $50,000 for the total project cost what we have budgeted today and most also motion to amend the budget in the amount of $50,000 for the total project cost all right thank you uh miss champagne is there a second all right second for council member nylon any council discussion yes mr. remaro let's see one second please yes okay is this including the sidewalk from agave area to um an altar no this is not included because you said some blazes yeah this doesn't have sidewalk and that this is just a turn away okay yeah this is so no expansion of the road even where are we doing you're saying you're doing a left turn lane into going into st blaze in front of cedar hills or there's it's we have to it's turn yeah that's what I'm saying so we're expanding the road right yes and color okay are we gonna look at that potentially by all the works or the sidewalk yeah since we're covering the ditch I know we talked about that a long time ago oh yeah i'll look at it yeah if there's enough room there I mean I'm not definitely not opposed to I mean we have sidewalk on the other side uh part of what dominoes the storage facility some of that does but then it doesn't when you get to coastal climate there's nothing right yeah because yeah yeah there was no ordinance at that time yeah yeah yeah but then was it autosome I think they have autosome they do so I mean it's a small stretch that's all I'm asking I know that yeah awesome thanks right any other comment anyone wishing to address the council all right uh mischiedry please call the vote mr. nightland yes yes yes mr. Ramara yes motion approved all right thank you council we'll get to work on that hopefully that's the first quarter project three left turns I think that'll be well received seven point two bid review for the long linear road extension the southern east west connector shim and i agree i've roadway improvements this is for phase one uh this is largely for I have a I do have an illustration here if anyone on the council wishes to see it it's basically reconstruction of the existing road from datant to uh just shy of the of the sharp uh 90 degree churn and then it picks back up on the other side of the 90 degree churn and goes to ge out road correct we're saving that middle section for a future phase phase two we're still in the process of some right away acquisitions there this project or both projects I should say the one that you just approved and this project are both 80% funded through a state capital outlay grant that we received mr. mara motion approved the bid for a long linear road extension with the amendment to the budget in the amount of 305 000 for total project costs all right thank you second all right misshump on seconds any council comment any public comment or question about the the scope of this project all right if there's no public comment miss gidry please call the vote miss shampoen yes as far as yes mr. bulgeiano yes mr. remera yes mr. nylon yes motion approved hamden you recall hamden you recall offhand like how many contract days were on these projects 270 which we know the turn lanes won't take uh shim and agriab we don't think either one they were given 270 mostly because of with we know what whether we're coming into with the first of the year and with different other road closures and making sure that not knowing and you not knowing who the contract would be but now you have the same contractor so yeah we'll have to be strategic particularly on shaman agriab because that will involve some road road closures on that project when we do get there so we'll try to look at that in relation to some of the other projects that we have going on but the one but 92 is going to be with under traffic yeah so my recommendation because of shaman agriab using being used by sugar cane farmers until I don't want anybody to touch that until after we know the farmers are done with moving because it's not like there's an alt a quick alternate route we don't want any of that in our subdivisions so we know that that'll kind of get a late start on 92 we'll sit with the contractor what we don't want and I hate to say these two words modigrapare what we don't want is anything on 92 that could disrupt or be under construction we know the parades early so we're going to accommodate all of that but by the time they get their structures get their things in so I would I would anticipate and what we're going to encourage on the two is to start on that project first if they have a crew if now it's different crews so they can do drainage on one with the other one but what we are trying to do is not have all of them under construction at the same time so we are coordinating with la rivier road and a fortune road would be opened by that time so we know fortune roads going to be opened by that time and then we'll focus but our focus is to get in and do 92 as quickly as possible while allowing cane farmers to still use shame agriab and then get in on shame agriab at that point in time when before the cane farmers start again in October being and we want to be in and out before they start needing it again all right thank you Pam let's see agenda item 8.1 resolution 2025 25 resolution authorizing the middle of water sector program phase 2 grant application approving local match and interning to agreements

yes all right susan you ready all right we both susan susan pamm any council announcements will take from there so are anyone from anyone from my right yeah literally all right hey so for the waste water treatment plant upgrade we're getting shop drawings from the contractor so that they can place the equipment orders they don't really want to mobilize until they know the equipment's coming in because it's disruptive the water plant we're probably like 99 percent complete now they're working on the automation of the elevate the controls of the elevated tank they're getting the generators operational the one at the plant and then the relocated one from well seven to well nine so they're getting that done probably this week the sugarmere upon upgrade we finally do have a route we met with tried and the developers and so we're going to get that underway working on the Gulf South pipeline agreement and we're going to be working on the servitudes should be minimal servitudes because the route that we chose and pump station five we're trying to finish that up then we'll just wait for funding music to my ears when I hear minimal servitudes thank you thank you any questions for susan related to the projects all right a lot of progress on the on the utility system so thank you and yes we are at the finish line with the water plant we made this decision just to temporarily delay the expansion of our service area because we were waiting for the waiting for gas lines to be extended to our generator that's on the side so an event of a power failure we have a natural gas generator so we thought it was incumbent on us to wait until the full emergency power back up was online before we start expanding the service area but all right there's no questions relative to the utility projects pan anything when you're in hi 89 going smoothly i'm sure everybody's seen they're putting in the select fill and then there'll be solsummit we do have our plans ready for phase one a which is to get it that do the transition that goes towards a russo road we do have the plans and we have our cost estimate and a cost estimate from the contractor i'm going to meet with the mayor so we can go over all of those we made some modifications per your request and to see if that's something we want to amend to their contract as they're getting closer to that phase the fortune part of it they were doing concrete for their their drainage transitions today they'll be doing that and then you'll start seeing the select fill and solsummit has been coming in for that area larivia road they're going really well close to the thanks given holiday i think when the kids are out of school the intersection of almanaster the east side of almanaster we need to lay pipe to cross almanaster so that intersection during the during school time will probably need to be closed for that week for them to lay um the we're not going to disrupt school it may even happen after school let's out that Friday deputies there are is there a game the Friday before Thanksgiving you don't know oh yeah i don't watch football so that's why i ask okay well can't keep me posted yeah okay so keep me posted if there's no game there's no home game then they may close it after all kids are dispersing everybody's there because they may work the Saturday if the weather's good they might work the Saturday so that they can make sure to get it done before the Thanksgiving so I did they wanted to do it before and I said we had to wait till school was out but they're moving making that much progress on the east side so they'll be trying to finish up that east side quickly before doing any road closures for the bridge repair i guess couldn't how long does that go i mean there could be potentially another game after that home home game next Friday and then after that it depends on top seed or not if they lose or win so we it could be an away game that we can okay yeah just let us know if for some reason between that Saturday and the day before Thanksgiving i mean that's what we're trying to plan for them to lay those couple of pipes in those inlets it should only take them two days but every time we say something's two days it never takes two days can they do it the week ago when they're out well that's the plan is so you only have that Monday so the Monday Tuesday and Wednesday most contractors take off the Thursday and Friday so yeah so what I didn't want is for something to not be finished on Wednesday and kids report back to school on Monday so my suggestion was if you need to work the Saturday and Sunday to facilitate it can you do that and the contractors say yes but if that has any impacts to the football that's why I wanted to wait that's why I asked let us know but that is the current plan is for them to try to get in and out of there and it's literally just to lay that so it's that part of the intersection that just won't be able to be used okay we'll keep in touch as that progresses phase one a for everyone's benefit of of 89 that's from heart to farm to basically ambassador that's the transition of where the current project ends and can we want to maximize the ability to have all the lanes as open as we can to ambassador if we don't do this next phase of work the taper will have to start back sooner towards ambassador or I'm sorry of the existing project we'll have to start tapering so don't get to utilize all of the lane that you're actually paving yeah if you don't do the transition yeah yeah but some of the work that we're doing that so that's the next phase that we're doing all right if there's no questions about the Riviera 89 fortune any council announcements welcome to you if you do miss champagne I just want to it's not an announcement that I would like to congratulate council and nylon on his new little bundle of joy Juliet I think she was born like the day after you left here last month congratulations had her working today at the at a ribbon cutting block and off traffic yeah thank you miss champagne mr. nylon and it's not an announcement but it is from my wife I just want to wish her a happy anniversary it's tomorrow so five years it's an important announcement yeah all right thank you sir mr. mara yeah uh first uh I know we got a couple veterans happy veterans day it's very important your service we appreciate it uh yes south side is playing the first home playoff game in the brand new stadium on Friday 7 p.m we take on a prairieville paracans they are schooled us on the around I think two years now so it's very important if you want to come see some great uh high school football come out if they win yes I'll play again in home and then from there you just kind of kind of see the bracket a great team though great environment I know y'all have been out of a couple of times chief too I mean it's it's something that I think we all wish for for so long and now we have that in our community and I think it's going to be great over the next several years the growth that we're seeing that area so glad you had to see our work and so well with them too yeah absolutely thank you and mr. oljana yeah uh the kiddie and veterans alliance is having a battle the branches uh solve alternative and then a home run derby next Friday and Saturday uh you'll be able to witness uh myself council in nylon and uh councilman stands very swing about and either whiff air may contact I'm not really sure which one's going to happen but uh it's uh it's an honor to be able to participate in this event that's for great calls raising money for our veterans and um that'll be Friday at 6 p.m. the 21st and then Saturday they'll have a a soft alternative to go to follow the second day so bring out the family and come witness a good time and uh donate to great calls all right thank you sir uh be remiss if I didn't add that young civil middle has did a phenomenal job with their with their football team in in a year where the college and the saints haven't really been all that to see thank goodness for our local sports young civil middle got the great opportunity to play at the dome uh last sunday and they did have a win against St. Martinville so we're very proud of them and in fact chief um and anyone that wants to be involved we we are making taking some initial steps maybe do something nice parade or something so we we need to connect on that to see what we can work out for them uh and the only other comment that I have that I want it to bring up and then I'll open it up to our team if they have any comments is about Marty Gras uh Marty Gras February 14th Marty Gras parade in young civil February 14th we have as typical for us we have started the conversations about planning that we are taking the road projects into consideration uh be variable this year um that's different is south of the Riviera road uh while it's restricted to one way south today uh we fully anticipate that around the time of the parade that it's going to be completely restricted because of the two drain or two bridge crossings and regardless even if it is still in the condition it is today it's no condition for floats to to be passing down so we are factoring that into the route for the uh Marty Gras parade on February 14th um I say that cautiously but I say that cautiously because we are doing it with safety in mind um if there's anyone that has strong feelings our opinion about it uh please contact me and let me know soon um I will tell you that the only potential change to the route may be just a reversal of the existing route same route just a reversal of the existing route um we're just going through parade day logistics that don't necessarily involve the exact parade route but more so how the how the floats enter and exit the community how they line up before the parade and how they're dispersed after the parade because there's a lot of work that goes into that outside of just the actual parade route itself so if there is any modification to the route it would be a reversal on the same route but again I'm saying this with enough notice to the public to where if there's opinions or strong feelings we'll certainly weigh that in but uh safety is ultimately going to make the decisions there so anyone from the team Terry Catherine Haley you've waited so patiently Yes ma'am all right um I just wanted uh if any of the restaurant owners or listening November 18th you should have received an email or someone on your team whoever I've got contact info for should have
