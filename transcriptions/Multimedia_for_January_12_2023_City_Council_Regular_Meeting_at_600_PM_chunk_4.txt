often, which in return, you know, everybody benefits. So from people that don't live in the area like, man, this is a cool community, man. Hey, what about bringing a business here? You know, it can trickle in all those rivers, you know what I mean? So thanks for having me. That's pretty much it. The Bayou Jiu Jitsu League is the tournament. So if you guys are in the area, we'd love to support there to support our school. And everybody that you might know that that can be competing in it. So it'll be pretty cool. Yeah, February level. We appreciate your leadership in the community. Property owner on church street right in the heart of our city. So you an excellent partner. We appreciate all that you do. And for bringing the tournament to young zool and we look forward to supporting you and helping you with anything that we can there as well. Thank you. Appreciate you. All right. Thank you so much. Look forward to it. All right. And we'll go with 4.2. The Young zool historic society. Miss Glenda Brian is going to discuss some things and counsel. I shared with you a late addition to your email. But Clint has it also and I've asked him to kind of go through that. So. Thank you, Mayor and council appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening. I'm here on behalf of the Young'sville Historical Preservation Society. And we were officially formed in 2019 in September. And we are guided by our mission statement, which is to preserve, celebrate and share the history of Young'sville Louisiana. Since our inception, our 14 charter members have worked toward a goal of having a historical museum for the city of Young'sville. And hoping that visitors and residents alike would be able to enjoy and learn about our history and our culture. In recent days, we've become aware of an opportunity that may be a perfect fit for a museum. The home is located on Lafayette Street, just a short walk from city hall from the municipal complex. And it is one of the oldest homes in our area that's still here. It's about 110 years old. It is it's just a hand, it's just one of a handful of the city's homes that are still standing. At one time, this home was also a company home for the refinery that was here in Young'sville. And it actually does back up. It's adjacent to the refinery property. There are a lot of reasons why it would be beneficial to have a museum for Young'sville. While Young'sville is not currently known for its tourism, a museum may inspire others with ideas that will encourage visitors to our city. Museums create a sense of well-being and help us feel proud of where we are from and where we live. Museums are a critical component to preserving our local culture where we came from and where we hoped to go. Historical
