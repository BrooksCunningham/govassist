the council is we we were able to successfully compete in we're awarded a five million dollar grant for water improvements and a five million dollar grant for sewer improvements the caveat with both of those is that you have to they it's a grant but they want to make sure that your your system the feasibility of your income is sufficient to be able to operate and maintain set plant wants to give you the grant so it was so what has happened is we've now been submitted with a draft report for water and sewer it's a rate study and the draft report I mean just to throw it out there is basically a $1,300 impact fee for new connections to water I'm not talking about a resident moving in or out I'm talking about new development new construction new development so we're talking about development costs not you know buying a new house in an existing neighborhood so with their draft report is this $1,300 for a water impact fee and I'm sorry you just told me the sewer one I think it was 1700 1700 for for sewer so while we're reviewing that draft report I think it's also incumbent on us now that we have a new CFO we have some new internal staff I want to regroup with you just to review the project and to also review you know like the scope of the project the benefit of the project the expected OPC and then also the you know the debt service on that project just so we can kind of you know in the room come to the same agreement you know with with not not specific I mean we look at the end of the day if we have to accept you know a $1,300 water connection fee and a $1,700 sewer connection fee for new development from a certain date forward that may be the cost of doing business because and we're evaluating that because reality is that's $10 million in grants that are on the line to receive those funding even if we put this hypothetically this water plan out to bid what I want to make sure what I want to what I want to make sure about the water plan is hypothetically if it came in under budget you may say well you don't need the grant but the reality is what you still want to accept $5 million grant regardless of what the bid price is on the water plan so I think we need to have just a little bit of a conversation internally you know just so we can I can get on your team players up to speed you know on that and then also you know with regards to like the I mean this has been a progressive project no different than you know building a road I mean we've drilled we have three new deep water wells that we can't use
