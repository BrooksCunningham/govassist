a dip in income in the current year down to 27,000 mainly because of an increase in expenditures. But then you see that operating income climbed back up to almost a quarter million, 240,000 in fiscal 25. You do have in the non-opperating revenue section, this is that property tax that we mentioned in the budget message. You can see it came in five, it's called 3% military. It came in at 536,000 in 23, 588,000 in 24. And then for fiscal 25, as was referenced in the budget message, an increase of 9.3% to 642,000. You do have a little bit of interest income and expanse here, but the main source of the non-operating revenues. And then worth mentioning that state grant you have in 25. So right below the property tax in fiscal year 25, $400,000 in state grant for capital outlay purposes. So there's quite a bit of non-opperating revenues, particularly in $25 over a million. That's the water department. Any questions? Let's keep on moving to the sewer department. Next page, page 30, same approach. Revenue's in 2023 coming in at 2.2 million. Healthy increase to about 2.5 million in the current year. And then 2 million, 752 in fiscal 25. So a nice study increases in the revenues between 23, 24 and 25. We can actually look at the total expenditures toward the bottom of this page, second to last line. 23 came in at 1,865. Actually went down. You don't see this very commonly, but it does go down to 1,822 in fiscal 24. And then back up to 2,219 in fiscal 25. But like we saw in water, operating incomes all three years, 355,023, almost 660,000 expected in the current year. And then for the budget year, an income of $533,000. Good healthy incomes all years. If we go to the next page on 31, we typically don't have a lot of non-operating revenues in the sewer, but it is worth mentioning the state grants. So fairly small state grant and fiscal 24, 54,000. But I would say a very large state grant in fiscal 25 at 2.1 million. Want to point those out, because you don't typically have numbers quite that big from the state grants side here in Utility. But here this year we do. That is a sewer department. Any questions here? Let's move on to sanitation. Settitation revenues in 23,000 and a million, six. An increase of approximately 315,000 to a million, 962, and almost the exact same dollar increase from 24,25 by 315,000 to 2,278. Toward the bottom end of the page, you can see the total expenditures came in at 2,300,000, 8, they do increase in 24 to 2.1 million, and in 25 to 2.4 million, and bottom line operating, we're showing in his income, but it's a loss all three years in this case. 204,000 loss in 23, 175,000 loss in 24, and 150,000 loss in 2025. So possibly some of the adjustments that would go
