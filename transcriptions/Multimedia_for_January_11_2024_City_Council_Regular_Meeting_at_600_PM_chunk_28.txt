start to get a visual of where where it'll go yeah so it is it is better because we're connecting there and then come back towards doing our roundabout so and because all you drain and joy start downstream work your way up so that is why so hopefully in the next month or so you start seeing them coming back towards 89 um we had some great meetings with do2d and the apc so we're now at a point we are putting together the gmp's for concurrence with facility plan control we do have a new project manager there's a lot of people that moved around at state agencies i'm sure you know and um so we are going to um i think so the colon i for sure are going to go down there and just kind of meet the project manager and kind of give it to him in person to explain the projects thinking you know so he'll understand what's going on he is new to the agency and so here we are handing him cmr 90% concurrence on projects so hopefully if we can get concurrence then you would have the full contracts for the fortune road and 89 signed so the contractor couldn't move straight in from all of his early work he's doing into the actual final construction for those projects our detention ponds of course are complete we're doing final paperwork we do have a couple of punch list items um some a little bit of erosion on a on a concrete slab that we want them to address um so we're holding retainage for that to happen so uh but i'm sure you've noticed with the rain they've been working very well so glad to have them in place when we did um we are submitting our we have our drainage and bridge study reports to submit to for la rivier road we've working with deotd it's still scheduled for this fiscal year to start construction on la rivier uh anzalum kooley we've completed our modeling and we've gotten feedback on environmental documentation of course they want to do archeological investigations so because they want archeological investigations and um i think we have a butterfly could possibly have a butterfly issue on one of them you know how you have to check and make sure you have potential anyway in doing the environmental we're asking them for an extension on the plans because i don't want to submit plans and then have an archeological issue come up so we are doing survey so the contractor is there um i mean the surveyor is taking cross sections so basically behind route 92 all the way down anzalum to um bero so that we can have new cross sections in there but we do have six alternatives and i need to sit down with you mayor on the six alternatives with which property owners we want to start meeting with um to move
