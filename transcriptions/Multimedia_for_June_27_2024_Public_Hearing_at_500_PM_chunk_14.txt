that okay so the net excess of deficiency you see those numbers we just talked about let's look at twenty three for example remember I said it was an eighteen million dollar surplus that's what it showed on page four then twenty four it was a big deficit of ten million and in twenty five it was another deficit of seven million eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars okay but remember that's that's capital improvements there and there's also some bonded debt and some regular debt that you have through the eq loans and whatever so we want to do this we want to add back the capital because capital is not something that you have to spend every year you do have some year because of the expansion but it's not it's not a definitive thing to operate the city so the first on the let's look at twenty three for example total additions which is all the capital outlay sixteen million seven hundred and forty eight thousand dollars okay that we have here that was last year this year's twenty three million four sixty three everybody sees that that's up to and then for the budget year which is right off the budget document that we just looked at with the detail of thirty six million fifty two thousand dollars so we've got to add that back because those are capital items they're not operational then though we're going to take off the bonds that we may have issued and any extraordinary items that we don't get on a recurring basis so that's the second class of items listed there bond proceeds capital lease proceeds orper and federal money settlement proceeds and grants a lot of which is state grants so let's look at that in twenty three right before that blackboard that's on the page or blueboard that's on the page you can see we subtracting out the funding thirty one million five forty four so that eighteen million dollars surplus in twenty three when I add those items subtract certain items I end up with an operating surplus for the city of about four million one hundred fifty nine dollars one hundred fifty nine thousand dollars everybody sees that number okay and you can read back towards the left and you see the numbers for every year these are actual numbers per the audit and it was an actual number for the audit for twenty three now let's look at the same scenario for twenty four started with a ten million dollar deficit adding back twenty three million dollars of capital outlay subtracting out the debt that was issued this year is about eight and a half million that leaves you with a surplus operational surplus for this year of about four point two million dollars okay same analogy for twenty five starting with a deficit of seven million eight fifty adding back the capital of thirty six million but subtracting out the other deductions mainly
