today and that way we can be in essence in charge of our own destiny but it's largely over largely related to our ability to continue growing but as you know over the past year we've had some severe weather issues drought we had a we had an interesting drought where there was some water pressure issues across a lot of water systems the LUS wholesale system was not immune from that and then also more recently the freeze those are variables that have affected our system further I think emphasizing the need that we need to be finalizing the plans to move forward but when we do move forward with those plans it's going to be in a scrub down version of the original initial design but still achieve the same goals to where we can produce more water and purchase less so we appreciate you working with this because I know you were very close to the finish line so look forward to bringing more conversations to the council about that topic soon so all right thank you Susan okay so on the roadway improvements we are milling and overlaying right now in both field crest and devinway most of the milling has finished we did have to do a couple more patches but the weather provided we should be finished with overlay I'm thinking by in the next week maybe beginning of the following I know we have the holiday I think they're planning on working Monte Grau day you know if weather's good because I'm gonna be around so there's you know with our parade being on Saturday in fact I even told them that after the roads close I didn't have a problem with them overlaying if that's what they needed to do in on on devinway you know in devinway if they wanted to do it just to kind of get away they can't overlay on field crest I'm very well over it yeah no it's not but they haven't asked but if that was I know last year we did have a detention ponds working while we were all doing the Monte Grau parade because the contract had worked on on the Saturday the Seymour projects so Glilagia did start moving some of their dirt to where the road would be started removing top soil of course we got hit with a two inch rain so we also got to a GMP for both projects for what we're calling phase one so phase one again going back to the funding the mayor talked about between funding and what you guys have in priority one with capital outlay your phase one a fortune road will be your roundabout and the road extending to Fairfield with Rousard your phase one A is now going on 89 is still fortune road but two heart to farm so based upon your funding we're gonna get as far as heart to farm it's actually not fortune-route I'm sorry
