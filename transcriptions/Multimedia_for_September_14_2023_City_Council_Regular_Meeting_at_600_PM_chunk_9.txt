deputy CAO if I don't have a CAO so anyway I present to you Terry for chief operating officer and if I could I'll tell you a little bit about the next assignment that I'm proud to present to you as you know Ben Burley has announced his intention to retire at the end of this year so we sought out someone that could again best complement our team the skill set of our staff and be be a fresh set of eyes to a lot of things that are currently relevant for a community of growth of our size and we hired Ms. Catherine Gregg and February March of this year she assumed at that time the title of deputy chief financial officer and my expectation was that we would reorganize and promote her at the time of Ben's retirement well ladies and gentlemen I want you to know that Catherine started in early March and really drove the budget process nearly entirely with Ben's oversight similar to Terry just on a quick of time periods just earned my trust my confidence she's had a very distinguished career in the private sector of working at one of the major employers and a nearby parish she's a proud resident of Young'sville and has a degree in accounting but continuous education is something that she truly believes in so she's still in school today taking a night night classes for a master's in infomatics and I can tell you that having her skill set her knowledge of programs of how to she makes Excel dance as I say Ben Ben does a phenomenal job with it but I'm seeing pivot tables that I didn't even know could exist but anyway so these are not two new individuals gives me a lot of pride and satisfaction always have to be able to reorganize and shuffle within our current staff so she's modernized a lot of processes she's paying vendors quicker through automated ACH payments and the best news is she's just getting started so whereas we embark on the audit process we felt that now was a good time to make to ratify her appointment as well so Ben anything you'd like to add? I think Catherine's a wonderful addition to the city I feel very very good about the fact that when I leave you're in great hands with Catherine like you said she's very tech savvy she's started a lot of new processes I think they're going to be beneficial and she's cutting through a lot of red tape so she knows how I feel about her my hat's off to Catherine. Yeah well thank you so all right so Miss Shampine is that a nomination for both of the appointees or would you like to take them individually? How would you like to handle it? No sir it's for both of the individuals great job great appointments so I would like to nominate Terry Bork as your chief operating
