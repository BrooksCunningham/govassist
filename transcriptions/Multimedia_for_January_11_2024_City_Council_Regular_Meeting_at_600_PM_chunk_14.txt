into 22 well 22 ended up at 6.2 million and this year we're 2.5 but the overall if you look at the six-year average I have highlighted down at the bottom of this page the average for the past per year for the last six has been 3.6 million dollars so that's very good to have an operational surplus of this for the past six years the the the concern that I would have is that our revenues have now flattened off they've leveled off and Ken and I spoke today and I think our sales stocks are up maybe 1% Ken over the prior year but we had budgeted 4% so we're 3% behind budget on the revenues especially sales tax which is a big drive in force here but our expended years are there at a certain level and you've had to get them at that level so I would suggest that we just look at the expended years and Brad kind of pointed this out earlier and see if there's any areas where we can improve some efficiencies and possibly some reductions if we could to level off some of these expended years because our revenues have flattened Ken as you want to add anything to that we concur and we had talked about this we had the exit at the latter part of the year in December with with the administration we had talked about these particular factors so it's just something to consider and it's something to try and address I guess the last thing that I want to look at is going to be on page 58 if everybody will turn to that we'll quickly look at it we've been looking at the operations of the city page 58 and now what I want to do is look at a on a one page this is all of the assets of the city as well as the respective debts that the city has and what's our remaining surplus which is our surplus that we have accumulated over the years and what do we have going forward how much how many days can we operate or months can we operate the city with you know suppose we had a catastrophic event so we're going to get into that but look at the I'm going to focus on the third column on page 58 which is the total numbers as of June 30th of 23 compared to the totals and the fourth column which is June 30th of 22 so it's a snapshot it's a balance sheet it shows what's your assets what assets you had at year in what what liabilities you had at year in and what's our remaining surplus so our cash as you can see with 6.8 million last year the cash and interest bearing deposits this year is 6.2 million we do have another 4.2 million has been invested this year we didn't have any of that last year total current
