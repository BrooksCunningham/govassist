final grades high-go seating all the grow in is continuing is coming along so I think it's coming along just I'm probably into the summer I guess or yeah that's what I that's what I'm understanding too we already have dates booked for the new fields for for travel ball teams coming in on those hopefully we can if possible if the contract releases it to us ideally we can consider maybe opening pickle ball a little bit sooner but we'll have an open event later this year to be to be announced so all right thank you Tim and just since we were kind of quick on time Catherine you want to give a little update on the finances would you let me to do so so what you have in front of you is we ended the 2024 the June 30th 1.15% higher over last year so for self-present thank you Catherine to encourage you think about it that shared with the couple of council members earlier was the last two months have been positive 7 over 7% higher than the same month previous year and then just under 4% for the most current month same month year over year so I think we're trending in the right direction as I know we did adopt a budget that showed a 0% increase on sales tax revenue so this will be the first month you know we haven't accounted for yet of the new fiscal year but hopefully we'll be able to continue the trend from the last two months and be off to a good start for this fiscal year just I wrote down a couple comments while I was listening earlier first I just want to congratulate councilman creed on st.
