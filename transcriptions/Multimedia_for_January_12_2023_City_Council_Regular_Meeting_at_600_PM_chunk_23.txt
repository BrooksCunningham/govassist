expandable to have extra amenities there The fields We're proposing for your consideration that we move forward two or the four fuels now But that there would also still be green grassy area that can be used on those Expansion areas some very similar to what we did for sugar beach on those expansion areas. We would still have the ability to do Flag football potentially soccer any type of warm up grass area just like you saw at sugar beach And then we're still proposing the full build out of the pickleball site and parking parking Partial parking I believe it's somewhere about 250 spaces in the first in this first phase So what's not included and still the concession building there's a million dollar allowance for the concession building in restrooms What's not included in it would be two of the four fields What we're proposing is to do the two fields that are closest to the amphitheater so That way that still has the same appearance that we intended With the fields closest to the amphitheater being built out But what's not what's not included currently in this proposal that's in front of you is two of the four fields baseball softball fields And then the pickleball area. I'm sorry excuse me the cornhole area and amphitheater scaled down staging This is very limited landscaping and some of the other features that were initially in that first cost proposal So with that said we're also working with the consultant the Cymar process has been working very well I mean the plans are nearly complete, but we're in a position where um I would like the contractor to proceed with doing their final cost estimates and What I'm describing to you I think in the in the paper that I put in front of you um, thank you is um, this is the the construction Cost and right now I think we're only at about them somewhere We're further ahead in the 60% number, but we're not at the guarantee maximum price yet But we're currently at about 11 Million five hundred dollars for what I just outlined and described for you The funding source as you know is going to be from our bond capacity that we had previously discussed We had we had capacity to continue to borrow against that one-sense dedicated sales tax for parks and recreation So this would be basic a continuation of that We would have some more paperwork to bring before you with our bond in attorneys to move forward with that um, so just kind of wanted to give you a high level overview of them I mean kind of we we're still in a position where we think we can achieve the full master plan of what you have presented there Cost has have just gone up quite a bit uh, you know turf turf is a big component of it Electrical is a big component of it and
