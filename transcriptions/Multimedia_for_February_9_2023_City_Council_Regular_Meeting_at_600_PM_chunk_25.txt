that, like you said, the sound is louder in my house, rattles my walls than what it sounds like outside. One time an officer came in and he was out of compliance. They took a reading of it, they he was out of compliance and we have called every time it's been night level and only that one officer actually had a decifold reader. They all can get it on their phones. That was probably, that was a new officer that went to your house. He had not been struck yet how to download it. But they had everybody else has it on their phones. There is a noise meter that gets calibrated every year and it's passed around throughout, but we also get noise complaints in the day. So we transfer it to the daytime also. May I ask a question, ma'am? Yes ma'am. Your complaints? Have they been strictly food truck complaints? Or have they been building music inside the building complaints? Where your complaints been? It has been both. Currently the food truck is behind my house. I can literally hear if someone goes in order. I can hear them play the order. I mean not play the order, but hear the cook cooking it, the cook smoking outside, my children are playing right there, the language speaking. I mean I have a picture that you can see the food truck is open to my house and I can see them through the fence. It's an invasion of my property. Is the first house right here? 101 is my property? And it kind of brings back a question about the new bar that's opening. What type of license was this? Because I don't even think it's 25 feet from my property line. I can't speak to the alcohol license because that's issued by the state. I believe they just look at schools. I don't think there's a requirement for residential buffers. We don't have a requirement that's more stringent than the state. What we do do is the land use discussion that we had with the other parcel was because that was a newer building. This building was built prior to the enactment of the land use ordinance. Hence the reason why there's not as much of a buffer zone between the rear property line and property line. Because it's really just my fence. That's correct. There's I mean there's no bushes. You can see everything. There's no sound barrier. It's my fence and there. So the waves of sound is you can hear it over the music in my house. You can hear sometimes I can dance to their music if I really want to. You can hear it and officers will tell you when they come in my house it's louder than what it is outside. I have no idea why either. But it is every single time and the one time that we called and the officer who actually had the desuper reader it
