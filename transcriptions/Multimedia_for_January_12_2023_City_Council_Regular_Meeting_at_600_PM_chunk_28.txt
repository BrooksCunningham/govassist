funded by a grant that has been years in the making so it's really great to hear that it's at 60% Upon the completion of this that spot that's low that always goes underwater will be something of yesterday The timing significant because just downstream from there near south side high school Pam said the project is underway with the contractor for the 20 acre detention basin on On the La Salle Cooley so right when we have a place to store the water the project is going to be underway to move the water quicker to the pond That way it won't be flooding south the Riviera road and we'll finally have The safe a safer passage that's the city's property there that the works going under Where the Cooley's going and the kind of like that that right that yeah right where the cursor is moving Um, but that's that's not really what you're gonna see now Well, we are gonna see now is dirt moving off of that site you're gonna see dirt moving off of We have four drainage projects to the south of the sports complex along by you park Purdue That contractor's mobilized. They're doing some on that property. That's just illustrated there It's four different ponds because of different pipelines that are crossing there So you're going to be seeing a massive amount of dirt being removed from that property hopefully leaving the city limits and then The with regard to the funding for the Anselam project that's a huge one because three main drains in our city Two of them we have millions of dollars of federal funding for drainage projects that's underway today with contractors mobilized on the west side of our city the Anselam Cooley As a team here. We've done some some smaller private public partnerships um, but we are this project that pams Was successfully getting some funding in from another source of funding the LWI Creates something that we wouldn't even really on our It was on our radar But we thought that the best we may be able to do is the public private partnerships that we've already accomplished there But if this gives us another nature-based solutions really just another way to say Recreational feature water constant water surface elevation You know, so think of think in terms of that there So a lot of great things happening young zool highway I think the biggest path that you're going to see you're going to see that land next to sable poms being cleared dirt from these projects is going to be moved there to stack and For the roundabout and for the road to brusar the fortune extension and then traveling north on young zool highway Besides that dirt being moved in stationed along fortune you're going to see drainage work commence As the first phase From a sable poms north towards ambassador that's because a lot of cool things happening There, yes, thank you
